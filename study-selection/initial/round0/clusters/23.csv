GACNNMDA: a computational model for predicting potential human microbe-drug associations based on graph attention network and CNN-based classifier,"As new drug targets, human microbes are proven to be closely related to human health. Effective computational methods for inferring potential microbe-drug associations can provide a useful complement to conventional experimental methods and will facilitate drug research and development. However, it is still a challenging work to predict potential interactions for new microbes or new drugs, since the number of known microbe-drug associations is very limited at present. In this manuscript, we first constructed two heterogeneous microbe-drug networks based on multiple measures of similarity of microbes and drugs, and known microbe-drug associations or known microbe-disease-drug associations, respectively. And then, we established two feature matrices for microbes and drugs through concatenating various attributes of microbes and drugs. Thereafter, after taking these two feature matrices and two heterogeneous microbe-drug networks as inputs of a two-layer graph attention network, we obtained low dimensional feature representations for microbes and drugs separately. Finally, through integrating low dimensional feature representations with two feature matrices to form the inputs of a convolutional neural network respectively, a novel computational model named GACNNMDA was designed to predict possible scores of microbe-drug pairs. Experimental results show that the predictive performance of GACNNMDA is superior to existing advanced methods. Furthermore, case studies on well-known microbes and drugs demonstrate the effectiveness of GACNNMDA as well.

Predicting gene regulatory links from single-cell RNA-seq data using graph neural networks,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying gene expression patterns at the single-cell level. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from scRNA-seq data provides insight into cellular phenotypes from the genomic level. However, the high sparsity, noise and dropout events inherent in scRNA-seq data present challenges for GRN inference. In recent years, the dramatic increase in data on experimentally validated transcription factors binding to DNA has made it possible to infer GRNs by supervised methods. In this study, we address the problem of GRN inference by framing it as a graph link prediction task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called GNNLink, which leverages known GRNs to deduce the potential regulatory interdependencies between genes. First, we preprocess the raw scRNA-seq data. Then, we introduce a graph convolutional network-based interaction graph encoder to effectively refine gene features by capturing interdependencies between nodes in the network. Finally, the inference of GRN is obtained by performing matrix completion operation on node features. The features obtained from model training can be applied to downstream tasks such as measuring similarity and inferring causality between gene pairs. To evaluate the performance of GNNLink, we compare it with six existing GRN reconstruction methods using seven scRNA-seq datasets. These datasets encompass diverse ground truth networks, including functional interaction networks, Loss of Function/Gain of Function data, non-specific ChIP-seq data and cell-type-specific ChIP-seq data. Our experimental results demonstrate that GNNLink achieves comparable or superior performance across these datasets, showcasing its robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, we observe consistent performance across datasets of varying scales. For reproducibility, we provide the data and source code of GNNLink on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/sdesignates/GNNLink. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press."
HetDDI: a pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural network model for drug–drug interaction prediction,"The simultaneous use of two or more drugs due to multi-disease comorbidity continues to increase, which may cause adverse reactions between drugs that seriously threaten public health. Therefore, the prediction of drug–drug interaction (DDI) has become a hot topic not only in clinics but also in bioinformatics. In this study, we propose a novel pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) model named HetDDI, which aggregates the structural information in drug molecule graphs and rich semantic information in biomedical knowledge graph to predict DDIs. In HetDDI, we first initialize the parameters of the model with different pre-training methods. Then we apply the pre-trained HGNN to learn the feature representation of drugs from multi-source heterogeneous information, which can more effectively utilize drugs’ internal structure and abundant external biomedical knowledge, thus leading to better DDI prediction. We evaluate our model on three DDI prediction tasks (binary-class, multi-class and multi-label) with three datasets and further assess its performance on three scenarios (S1, S2 and S3). The results show that the accuracy of HetDDI can achieve 98.82% in the binary-class task, 98.13% in the multi-class task and 96.66% in the multi-label one on S1, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 2%. On S2 and S3, our method also achieves exciting performance. Furthermore, the case studies confirm that our model performs well in predicting unknown DDIs.

Semi-supervised heterogeneous graph contrastive learning for drug–target interaction prediction,"Identification of drug–target interactions (DTIs) is an important step in drug discovery and drug repositioning. In recent years, graph-based methods have attracted great attention and show advantages on predicting potential DTIs. However, these methods face the problem that the known DTIs are very limited and expensive to obtain, which decreases the generalization ability of the methods. Self-supervised contrastive learning is independent of labeled DTIs, which can mitigate the impact of the problem. Therefore, we propose a framework SHGCL-DTI for predicting DTIs, which supplements the classical semi-supervised DTI prediction task with an auxiliary graph contrastive learning module. Specifically, we generate representations for the nodes through the neighbor view and meta-path view, and define positive and negative pairs to maximize the similarity between positive pairs from different views. Subsequently, SHGCL-DTI reconstructs the original heterogeneous network to predict the potential DTIs. The experiments on the public dataset show that SHGCL-DTI has significant improvement in different scenarios, compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that the contrastive learning module improves the prediction performance and generalization ability of SHGCL-DTI through ablation study. In addition, we have found several novel predicted DTIs supported by the biological literature. The data and source code are available at: https://github.com/TOJSSE-iData/SHGCL-DTI. © 2023"
RDKG-115: Assisting drug repurposing and discovery for rare diseases by trimodal knowledge graph embedding,"Rare diseases (RDs) may affect individuals in small numbers, but they have a significant impact on a global scale. Accurate diagnosis of RDs is challenging, and there is a severe lack of drugs available for treatment. Pharmaceutical companies have shown a preference for drug repurposing from existing drugs developed for other diseases due to the high investment, high risk, and long cycle involved in RD drug development. Compared to traditional approaches, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) based methods are more efficient and convenient, as they treat drug repurposing as a link prediction task. KGE models allow for the enrichment of existing knowledge by incorporating multimodal information from various sources. In this study, we constructed RDKG-115, a rare disease knowledge graph involving 115 RDs, composed of 35,643 entities, 25 relations, and 5,539,839 refined triplets, based on 372,384 high-quality literature and 4 biomedical datasets: DRKG, Pathway Commons, PharmKG, and PMapp. Subsequently, we developed a trimodal KGE model containing structure, category, and description embeddings using reverse-hyperplane projection. We utilized this model to infer 4199 reliable new inferred triplets from RDKG-115. Finally, we calculated potential drugs and small molecules for each of the 115 RDs, taking multiple sclerosis as a case study. This study provides a paradigm for large-scale screening of drug repurposing and discovery for RDs, which will speed up the drug development process and ultimately benefit patients with RDs.

The OREGANO knowledge graph for computational drug repurposing,"Drug repositioning is a faster and more affordable solution than traditional drug discovery approaches. From this perspective, computational drug repositioning using knowledge graphs is a very promising direction. Knowledge graphs constructed from drug data and information can be used to generate hypotheses (molecule/drug - target links) through link prediction using machine learning algorithms. However, it remains rare to have a holistically constructed knowledge graph using the broadest possible features and drug characteristics, which is freely available to the community. The OREGANO knowledge graph aims at filling this gap. The purpose of this paper is to present the OREGANO knowledge graph, which includes natural compounds related data. The graph was developed from scratch by retrieving data directly from the knowledge sources to be integrated. We therefore designed the expected graph model and proposed a method for merging nodes between the different knowledge sources, and finally, the data were cleaned. The knowledge graph, as well as the source codes for the ETL process, are openly available on the GitHub of the OREGANO project (https://gitub.u-bordeaux.fr/erias/oregano). © 2023, The Author(s)."
IMAEN: An interpretable molecular augmentation model for drug–target interaction prediction,"Drug discovery is a crucial aspect of biomedical research, and predicting drug–target interactions (DTIs) is a vital step in this process. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance on graph learning tasks, including DTI prediction. However, existing DTI models using GNNs are insufficient to aggregate node neighborhood information and lack interpretability. In this study, we propose an interpretable molecular augmentation model named IMAEN for drug–target interaction prediction, which employs molecular augmentation mechanism to fully aggregate the molecular node neighborhood information, especially for the nodes with fewer neighborhoods. Moreover, we design an interpretable stack convolutional encoding module to process protein sequence from the perspective of multi-scale and multi-level interpretably. Compared with the existing models, our proposed model has the best effect and achieves the best performance on four benchmark datasets. The visualization of the model and interpretation of its predictions provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of drug–target interactions, which could assist researchers in narrowing the search space of binding sites and aid in the discovery of new drugs and targets.

Drug–target affinity prediction method based on multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization,"Drug–target affinity (DTA) prediction as an emerging and effective method is widely applied to explore the strength of drug–target interactions in drug development research. By predicting these interactions, researchers can assess the potential efficacy and safety of candidate drugs at an early stage, narrowing down the search space for therapeutic targets and accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. However, existing DTA prediction models mainly use graphical representations of drug molecules, which lack information on interactions between individual substructures, thus affecting prediction accuracy and model interpretability. Therefore, transformer and diffusion on drug graphs in DTA prediction (TDGraphDTA) are introduced to predict drug–target interactions using multi-scale information interaction and graph optimization. An interactive module is integrated into feature extraction of drug and target features at different granularity levels. A diffusion model-based graph optimization module is proposed to improve the representation of molecular graph structures and enhance the interpretability of graph representations while obtaining optimal feature representations. In addition, TDGraphDTA improves the accuracy and reliability of predictions by capturing relationships and contextual information between molecular substructures. The performance of the proposed TDGraphDTA in DTA prediction was verified on three publicly available benchmark datasets (Davis, Metz, and KIBA). Compared with state-of-the-art baseline models, it achieved better results in terms of consistency index, R-squared, etc. Furthermore, compared with some existing methods, the proposed TDGraphDTA is demonstrated to have better structure capturing capabilities by visualizing the feature capturing capabilities of the model using Grad-AAM toxicity labels in the ToxCast dataset.

Cooperation of local features and global representations by a dual-branch network for transcription factor binding sites prediction,"Interactions between DNA and transcription factors (TFs) play an essential role in understanding transcriptional regulation mechanisms and gene expression. Due to the large accumulation of training data and low expense, deep learning methods have shown huge potential in determining the specificity of TFs-DNA interactions. Convolutional network-based and self-attention network-based methods have been proposed for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) prediction. Convolutional operations are efficient to extract local features but easy to ignore global information, while self-attention mechanisms are expert in capturing long-distance dependencies but difficult to pay attention to local feature details. To discover comprehensive features for a given sequence as far as possible, we propose a Dual-branch model combining Self-Attention and Convolution, dubbed as DSAC, which fuses local features and global representations in an interactive way. In terms of features, convolution and self-attention contribute to feature extraction collaboratively, enhancing the representation learning. In terms of structure, a lightweight but efficient architecture of network is designed for the prediction, in particular, the dual-branch structure makes the convolution and the self-attention mechanism can be fully utilized to improve the predictive ability of our model. The experiment results on 165 ChIP-seq datasets show that DSAC obviously outperforms other five deep learning based methods and demonstrate that our model can effectively predict TFBSs based on sequence feature alone.

MoleRec: Combinatorial Drug Recommendation with Substructure-Aware Molecular Representation Learning,"Combinatorial drug recommendation involves recommending a personalized combination of medication (drugs) to a patient over his/her longitudinal history, which essentially aims at solving a combinatorial optimization problem that pursues high accuracy under the safety constraint. Among existing learning-based approaches, the association between drug substructures (i.e., a sub-graph of the molecule that contributes to certain chemical effect) and the target disease is largely overlooked, though the function of drugs in fact exhibits strong relevance with particular substructures. To address this issue, we propose a molecular substructure-aware encoding method entitled MoleRec that entails a hierarchical architecture aimed at modeling inter-substructure interactions and individual substructures' impact on patient's health condition, in order to identify those substructures that really contribute to healing patients. Specifically, MoleRec learns to attentively pooling over substructure representations which will be element-wisely re-scaled by the model's inferred relevancy with a patient's health condition to obtain a prior-knowledge-informed drug representation. We further design a weight annealing strategy for drug-drug-interaction (DDI) objective to adaptively control the balance between accuracy and safety criteria throughout training. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. four accuracy and safety metrics.

MF-PCBA: Multifidelity High-Throughput Screening Benchmarks for Drug Discovery and Machine Learning,"High-throughput screening (HTS), as one of the key techniques in drug discovery, is frequently used to identify promising drug candidates in a largely automated and cost-effective way. One of the necessary conditions for successful HTS campaigns is a large and diverse compound library, enabling hundreds of thousands of activity measurements per project. Such collections of data hold great promise for computational and experimental drug discovery efforts, especially when leveraged in combination with modern deep learning techniques, and can potentially lead to improved drug activity predictions and cheaper and more effective experimental design. However, existing collections of machine-learning-ready public datasets do not exploit the multiple data modalities present in real-world HTS projects. Thus, the largest fraction of experimental measurements, corresponding to hundreds of thousands of “noisy” activity values from primary screening, are effectively ignored in the majority of machine learning models of HTS data. To address these limitations, we introduce Multifidelity PubChem BioAssay (MF-PCBA), a curated collection of 60 datasets that includes two data modalities for each dataset, corresponding to primary and confirmatory screening, an aspect that we call multifidelity. Multifidelity data accurately reflect real-world HTS conventions and present a new, challenging task for machine learning: the integration of low- and high-fidelity measurements through molecular representation learning, taking into account the orders-of-magnitude difference in size between the primary and confirmatory screens. Here we detail the steps taken to assemble MF-PCBA in terms of data acquisition from PubChem and the filtering steps required to curate the raw data. We also provide an evaluation of a recent deep-learning-based method for multifidelity integration across the introduced datasets, demonstrating the benefit of leveraging all HTS modalities, and a discussion in terms of the roughness of the molecular activity landscape. In total, MF-PCBA contains over 16.6 million unique molecule-protein interactions. The datasets can be easily assembled by using the source code available at https://github.com/davidbuterez/mf-pcba. © 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society."
DDI-MuG: Multi-aspect graphs for drug-drug interaction extraction,"Introduction: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) may lead to adverse reactions in patients, thus it is important to extract such knowledge from biomedical texts. However, previously proposed approaches typically focus on capturing sentence-aspect information while ignoring valuable knowledge concerning the whole corpus. In this paper, we propose a Multi-aspect Graph-based DDI extraction model, named DDI-MuG. Methods: We first employ a bio-specific pre-trained language model to obtain the token contextualized representations. Then we use two graphs to get syntactic information from input instance and word co-occurrence information within the entire corpus, respectively. Finally, we combine the representations of drug entities and verb tokens for the final classification Results: To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we perform extensive experiments on two widely used DDI extraction dataset, DDIExtraction-2013 and TAC 2018. It is encouraging to see that our model outperforms all twelve state-of-the-art models. Discussion: In contrast to the majority of earlier models that rely on the black-box approach, our model enables visualization of crucial words and their interrelationships by utilizing edge information from two graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that explores multi-aspect graphs to the DDI extraction task, and we hope it can establish a foundation for more robust multi-aspect works in the future. 2023 Yang, Ding, Long, Poon and Han."
Predicting circRNA-drug resistance associations based on a multimodal graph representation learning framework,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of noncoding RNA that is highly conserved and exhibit exceptional stability. Due to its function as a microRNA sponge, circRNA has gained significant attention as an essential biomarker and potential drug target in the pathogenesis of several cancers. Although many circRNAs have been identified to play a role in cancer resistance, traditional methods are time-consuming and expensive. In this context, computational methods offer a promising way to facilitate the discovery process. However, most existing prediction models focus on the association between circRNAs and drug resistance, without considering the corresponding disease-related information in the circRNA-drug resistance association. Incorporating disease-related information into the prediction of circRNA-drug resistance associations could potentially improve the efficiency and speed of discovering and developing circRNA-targeting drugs. We propose a computational framework, named GraphCDD, for predicting the association between circRNA and drug resistance. Our model utilizes data from three sources, namely circRNA, disease, and drug, to construct three similarity networks that represent the features of circRNA, disease, and drug, respectively. We utilize a multimodal graph neural network to acquire efficient representations of circRNAs, diseases, and drugs by integrating various types of information, and establish a predictive model. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our model and provided a promising method in predicting potential associations between circRNA and drug resistance.

Decision Support System for Chronic Diseases Based on Drug-Drug Interactions,"Many patients with chronic diseases resort to multiple medications to relieve various symptoms, which raises concerns about the safety of multiple medication use, as severe drug-drug antagonism can lead to serious adverse effects or even death. This paper presents a Decision Support System, called DSSDDI, based on drug-drug interactions to support doctors prescribing decisions. DSSDDI contains three modules, Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) module, Medical Decision (MD) module and Medical Support (MS) module. The DDI module learns safer and more effective drug representations from the drug-drug interactions. To capture the potential causal relationship between DDI and medication use, the MD module considers the representations of patients and drugs as context, DDI and patients' similarity as treatment, and medication use as outcome to construct counterfactual links for the representation learning. Furthermore, the MS module provides drug candidates to doctors with explanations. Experiments on the chronic data collected from the Hong Kong Chronic Disease Study Project and a public diagnostic data MIMIC-III demonstrate that DSSDDI can be a reliable reference for doctors in terms of safety and efficiency of clinical diagnosis, with significant improvements compared to baseline methods.

Self-Supervised Graph Information Bottleneck for Multi-View Molecular Embedding Learning,"In the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD), identifying promising drug candidates from small molecule libraries requires meaningful molecular embeddings for downstream tasks, such as property prediction. However, obtaining experimentally determined molecular property measurements is often expensive and time-consuming, making it challenging to train molecular encoders with limited supervision. Additionally, molecules can be represented in two ways: as 2D chemical bond structures and 3D geometry structures. Molecular embedding learning using only one of these representations can result in information loss, and effective fusion of the two views has not been fully explored. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called the Self-supervised Multi-View Graph Neural Network (SMV-GNN) for molecular embedding learning. Our approach involves a self-supervised task that promotes the representation ability of the molecular encoder without requiring extra human-annotation data. Specifically, we use chemical-bond based graph structures as inputs to predict inter-atom distances from the 2D view and randomly shuffle a ratio of atoms in the 3D-coordinate based graphs to predict atom rationality from the 3D view. We further improve the representation ability of the molecular embedding by using information bottleneck to learn essential shared feature representations by discarding superfluous information from the 2D/3D views for downstream tasks. We evaluate our proposed SMV-GNN approach on seven benchmark datasets for molecule property prediction tasks and demonstrate that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

Predicting cancer drug response using parallel heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with neighborhood interactions,"Motivation: Due to cancer heterogeneity, the therapeutic effect may not be the same when a cohort of patients of the same cancer type receive the same treatment. The anticancer drug response prediction may help develop personalized therapy regimens to increase survival and reduce patients’ expenses. Recently, graph neural network-based methods have aroused widespread interest and achieved impressive results on the drug response prediction task. However, most of them apply graph convolution to process cell line-drug bipartite graphs while ignoring the intrinsic differences between cell lines and drug nodes. Moreover, most of these methods aggregate node-wise neighbor features but fail to consider the element-wise interaction between cell lines and drugs. Results: This work proposes a neighborhood interaction (NI)-based heterogeneous graph convolution network method, namely NIHGCN, for anticancer drug response prediction in an end-to-end way. Firstly, it constructs a heterogeneous network consisting of drugs, cell lines and the known drug response information. Cell line gene expression and drug molecular fingerprints are linearly transformed and input as node attributes into an interaction model. The interaction module consists of a parallel graph convolution network layer and a NI layer, which aggregates node-level features from their neighbors through graph convolution operation and considers the element-level of interactions with their neighbors in the NI layer. Finally, the drug response predictions are made by calculating the linear correlation coefficients of feature representations of cell lines and drugs. We have conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our model on Cancer Drug Sensitivity Data (GDSC) and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) datasets. It has achieved the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in predicting drug responses for new cell lines, new drugs and targeted drugs. Furthermore, our model that was well trained on the GDSC dataset can be successfully applied to predict samples of PDX and TCGA, which verified the transferability of our model from cell line in vitro to the datasets in vivo.

Deep Graph Networks for Drug Repurposing with Multi-Protein Targets,"In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, repurposing of drugs approved for use in other diseases helped counteract the aggressiveness of the virus. Therefore, the availability of effective and flexible methodologies to speed up and prioritize the repurposing process is fundamental to tackle present and future challenges to worldwide health. This work addresses the problem of drug repurposing through the lens of deep learning for graphs, by designing an architecture that exploits both structural and biological information to propose a reduced set of drugs that may be effective against an unknown disease. Our main contribution is a method to repurpose a drug against multiple proteins, rather than the most common single-drug/single-protein setting. The method leverages graph embeddings to encode the relevant proteins&#x0027; and drugs&#x0027; information based on gene ontology data and structural similarities. Finally, we publicly release a comprehensive and unified data repository for graph-based analysis to foster further studies on COVID-19 and drug repurposing. We empirically validate the proposed approach in a general drug repurposing setting, showing that it generalizes better than single protein repurposing schemes. We conclude the manuscript with an exemplified application of our method to the COVID-19 use case. All source code is publicly available. IEEE"
Predict multi-type drug–drug interactions in cold start scenario,"Background: Prediction of drug–drug interactions (DDIs) can reveal potential adverse pharmacological reactions between drugs in co-medication. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue. Most of them focus on the traditional link prediction between drugs, however, they ignore the cold-start scenario, which requires the prediction between known drugs having approved DDIs and new drugs having no DDI. Moreover, they're restricted to infer whether DDIs occur, but are not able to deduce diverse DDI types, which are important in clinics. Results: In this paper, we propose a cold start prediction model for both single-type and multiple-type drug–drug interactions, referred to as CSMDDI. CSMDDI predict not only whether two drugs trigger pharmacological reactions but also what reaction types they induce in the cold start scenario. We implement several embedding methods in CSMDDI, including SVD, GAE, TransE, RESCAL and compare it with the state-of-the-art multi-type DDI prediction method DeepDDI and DDIMDL to verify the performance. The comparison shows that CSMDDI achieves a good performance of DDI prediction in the case of both the occurrence prediction and the multi-type reaction prediction in cold start scenario. Conclusions: Our approach is able to predict not only conventional binary DDIs but also what reaction types they induce in the cold start scenario. More importantly, it learns a mapping function who can bridge the drugs attributes to their network embeddings to predict DDIs. The main contribution of CSMDDI contains the development of a generalized framework to predict the single-type and multi-type of DDIs in the cold start scenario, as well as the implementations of several embedding models for both single-type and multi-type of DDIs.

Dual-Channel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Predicting microRNA-Mediated Drug Sensitivity,"Many studies have confirmed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are mediated in the sensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer drugs. MiRNAs are emerging as a type of promising therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance. However, there is limited attention paid to the computational prediction of the associations between miRNAs and drug sensitivity. In this work, we proposed a heterogeneous network-based representation learning method to predict miRNA-drug sensitivity associations (DGNNMDA). An miRNA-drug heterogeneous network was constructed by integrating miRNA similarity network, drug similarity network, and experimentally validated miRNA-drug sensitivity associations. Next, we developed a dual-channel heterogeneous graph neural network model to perform feature propagation among the homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes so that our method can learn expressive representations for miRNA and drug nodes. On two benchmark datasets, our method outperformed other seven competitive methods. We also verified the effectiveness of the feature propagations on homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes. Moreover, we have conducted two case studies to verify the reliability of our methods and tried to reveal the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs mediated in drug sensitivity.

ncRNAInter: a novel strategy based on graph neural network to discover interactions between lncRNA and miRNA,"In recent years, many studies have illustrated the significant role that non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays in biological activities, in which lncRNA, miRNA and especially their interactions have been proved to affect many biological processes. Some in silico methods have been proposed and applied to identify novel lncRNA–miRNA interactions (LMIs), but there are still imperfections in their RNA representation and information extraction approaches, which imply there is still room for further improving their performances. Meanwhile, only a few of them are accessible at present, which limits their practical applications. The construction of a new tool for LMI prediction is thus imperative for the better understanding of their relevant biological mechanisms. This study proposed a novel method, ncRNAInter, for LMI prediction. A comprehensive strategy for RNA representation and an optimized deep learning algorithm of graph neural network were utilized in this study. ncRNAInter was robust and showed better performance of 26.7% higher Matthews correlation coefficient than existing reputable methods for human LMI prediction. In addition, ncRNAInter proved its universal applicability in dealing with LMIs from various species and successfully identified novel LMIs associated with various diseases, which further verified its effectiveness and usability.

REDDA: Integrating multiple biological relations to heterogeneous graph neural network for drug-disease association prediction,"Computational drug repositioning is an effective way to find new indications for existing drugs, thus can accelerate drug development and reduce experimental costs. Recently, various deep learning-based repurposing methods have been established to identify the potential drug-disease associations (DDA). However, effective utilization of the relations of biological entities to capture the biological interactions to enhance the drug-disease association prediction is still challenging. To resolve the above problem, we proposed a heterogeneous graph neural network called REDDA (Relations-Enhanced Drug-Disease Association prediction). Assembled with three attention mechanisms, REDDA can sequentially learn drug/disease representations by a general heterogeneous graph convolutional network-based node embedding block, a topological subnet embedding block, a graph attention block, and a layer attention block. Performance comparisons on our proposed benchmark dataset show that REDDA outperforms 8 advanced drug-disease association prediction methods, achieving relative improvements of 0.76% on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score and 13.92% on the precision-recall curve (AUPR) score compared to the suboptimal method. On the other benchmark dataset, REDDA also obtains relative improvements of 2.48% on the AUC score and 4.93% on the AUPR score. Specifically, case studies also indicate that REDDA can give valid predictions for the discovery of -new indications for drugs and new therapies for diseases. The overall results provide an inspiring potential for REDDA in the in silico drug development.

DFinder: a novel end-to-end graph embedding-based method to identify drug-food interactions,"MOTIVATION: Drug-food interactions (DFIs) occur when some constituents of food affect the bioaccessibility or efficacy of the drug by involving in drug pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic processes. Many computational methods have achieved remarkable results in link prediction tasks between biological entities, which show the potential of computational methods in discovering novel DFIs. However, there are few computational approaches that pay attention to DFI identification. This is mainly due to the lack of DFI data. In addition, food is generally made up of a variety of chemical substances. The complexity of food makes it difficult to generate accurate feature representations for food. Therefore, it is urgent to develop effective computational approaches for learning the food feature representation and predicting DFIs. RESULTS: In this article, we first collect DFI data from DrugBank and PubMed, respectively, to construct two datasets, named DrugBank-DFI and PubMed-DFI. Based on these two datasets, two DFI networks are constructed. Then, we propose a novel end-to-end graph embedding-based method named DFinder to identify DFIs. DFinder combines node attribute features and topological structure features to learn the representations of drugs and food constituents. In topology space, we adopt a simplified graph convolution network-based method to learn the topological structure features. In feature space, we use a deep neural network to extract attribute features from the original node attributes. The evaluation results indicate that DFinder performs better than other baseline methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code is available at https://github.com/23AIBox/23AIBox-DFinder.

idse-HE: Hybrid embedding graph neural network for drug side effects prediction,"In drug development, unexpected side effects are the main reason for the failure of candidate drug trials. Discovering potential side effects of drugs in silico can improve the success rate of drug screening. However, most previous works extracted and utilized an effective representation of drugs from a single perspective. These methods merely considered the topological information of drug in the biological entity network, or combined the association information (e.g. knowledge graph KG) between drug and other biomarkers, or only used the chemical structure or sequence information of drug. Consequently, to jointly learn drug features from both the macroscopic biological network and the microscopic drug molecules. We propose a hybrid embedding graph neural network model named idse-HE, which integrates graph embedding module and node embedding module. idse-HE can fuse the drug chemical structure information, the drug substructure sequence information and the drug network topology information. Our model deems the final representation of drugs and side effects as two implicit factors to reconstruct the original matrix and predicts the potential side effects of drugs. In the robustness experiment, idse-HE shows stable performance in all indicators. We reproduce the baselines under the same conditions, and the experimental results indicate that idse-HE is superior to other advanced methods. Finally, we also collect evidence to confirm several real drug side effect pairs in the predicted results, which were previously regarded as negative samples. More detailed information, scientific researchers can access the user-friendly web-server of idse-HE at http://bioinfo.jcu.edu.cn/idse-HE. In this server, users can obtain the original data and source code, and will be guided to reproduce the model results. © 2022"
AlphaFold2-aware protein-DNA binding site prediction using graph transformer,"Protein-DNA interactions play crucial roles in the biological systems, and identifying protein-DNA binding sites is the first step for mechanistic understanding of various biological activities (such as transcription and repair) and designing novel drugs. How to accurately identify DNA-binding residues from only protein sequence remains a challenging task. Currently, most existing sequence-based methods only consider contextual features of the sequential neighbors, which are limited to capture spatial information. Based on the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2, we propose an accurate predictor, GraphSite, for identifying DNA-binding residues based on the structural models predicted by AlphaFold2. Here, we convert the binding site prediction problem into a graph node classification task and employ a transformer-based variant model to take the protein structural information into account. By leveraging predicted protein structures and graph transformer, GraphSite substantially improves over the latest sequence-based and structure-based methods. The algorithm is further confirmed on the independent test set of 181 proteins, where GraphSite surpasses the state-of-the-art structure-based method by 16.4% in area under the precision-recall curve and 11.2% in Matthews correlation coefficient, respectively. We provide the datasets, the predicted structures and the source codes along with the pre-trained models of GraphSite at https://github.com/biomed-AI/GraphSite.

3DGT-DDI: 3D graph and text based neural network for drug–drug interaction prediction,"Motivation: Drug–drug interactions (DDIs) occur during the combination of drugs. Identifying potential DDI helps us to study the mechanism behind the combination medication or adverse reactions so as to avoid the side effects. Although many artificial intelligence methods predict and mine potential DDI, they ignore the 3D structure information of drug molecules and do not fully consider the contribution of molecular substructure in DDI. Results: We proposed a new deep learning architecture, 3DGT-DDI, a model composed of a 3D graph neural network and pre-trained text attention mechanism. We used 3D molecular graph structure and position information to enhance the prediction ability of the model for DDI, which enabled us to deeply explore the effect of drug substructure on DDI relationship. The results showed that 3DGT-DDI outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. It achieved an 84.48% macro F1 score in the DDIExtraction 2013 shared task dataset. Also, our 3D graph model proves its performance and explainability through weight visualization on the DrugBank dataset. 3DGT-DDI can help us better understand and identify potential DDI, thereby helping to avoid the side effects of drug mixing.

DDIPred: Graph Convolutional Network-Based Drug-drug Interactions Prediction Using Drug Chemical Structure Embedding,"A drug-drug interaction (DDI) describes a circumstance in which drugs affect the activity of each other. Drugs may interact with each other to cause side effects that are unexpected or more severe than anticipated. Drugs may also interact and oppose the results of one another, leading to one (or both) medications not having their intended effect. Most drug interactions are negligible, but some can be significantly harmful if not discovered and appropriately overseen. DDI data can be helpful for other drug-related research topics such as drug repurposing and drug-target interaction, which leads to improving the drug development process. This paper presents a new method for DDI prediction named DDIPred. It is based on drug chemical structure embedding and graph convolutional networks for predicting new DDIs. DDIPred First extracts a representation of Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings using SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings (SELFIES) and Doc2Vec. Then the representation, along with the DDI network structure, is used to predict new DDIs. Our method achieved acceptable performance when tested on the BIOSNAP DDI network dataset while outperforming other existing methods.

Deepred-Mt: Deep representation learning for predicting C-to-U RNA editing in plant mitochondria,"In land plant mitochondria, C-to-U RNA editing converts cytidines into uridines at highly specific RNA positions called editing sites. This editing step is essential for the correct functioning of mitochondrial proteins. When using sequence homology information, edited positions can be computationally predicted with high precision. However, predictions based on the sequence contexts of such edited positions often result in lower precision, which is limiting further advances on novel genetic engineering techniques for RNA regulation. Here, a deep convolutional neural network called Deepred-Mt is proposed. It predicts C-to-U editing events based on the 40 nucleotides flanking a given cytidine. Unlike existing methods, Deepred-Mt was optimized by using editing extent information, novel strategies of data augmentation, and a large-scale training dataset, constructed with deep RNA sequencing data of 21 plant mitochondrial genomes. In comparison to predictive methods based on sequence homology, Deepred-Mt attains significantly better predictive performance, in terms of average precision as well as F1 score. In addition, our approach is able to recognize well-known sequence motifs linked to RNA editing, and shows that the local RNA structure surrounding editing sites may be a relevant factor regulating their editing. These results demonstrate that Deepred-Mt is an effective tool for predicting C-to-U RNA editing in plant mitochondria.

Drug-drug interaction prediction with learnable size-Adaptive molecular substructures,"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are interactions with adverse effects on the body, manifested when two or more incompatible drugs are taken together. They can be caused by the chemical compositions of the drugs involved. We introduce gated message passing neural network (GMPNN), a message passing neural network which learns chemical substructures with different sizes and shapes from the molecular graph representations of drugs for DDI prediction between a pair of drugs. In GMPNN, edges are considered as gates which control the flow of message passing, and therefore delimiting the substructures in a learnable way. The final DDI prediction between a drug pair is based on the interactions between pairs of their (learned) substructures, each pair weighted by a relevance score to the final DDI prediction output. Our proposed method GMPNN-CS (i.e. GMPNN + prediction module) is evaluated on two real-world datasets, with competitive results on one, and improved performance on the other compared with previous methods.

An end-to-end heterogeneous graph representation learning-based framework for drug-target interaction prediction,"Accurately identifying potential drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a key step in drug discovery. Although many related experimental studies have been carried out for identifying DTIs in the past few decades, the biological experiment-based DTI identification is still timeconsuming and expensive. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective computational methods for identifying DTIs. In this paper, we develop a novel 'end-to-end' learning-based framework based on heterogeneous 'graph' convolutional networks for 'DTI' prediction called end-to-end graph (EEG)-DTI. Given a heterogeneous network containing multiple types of biological entities (i.e. drug, protein, disease, side-effect), EEG-DTI learns the low-dimensional feature representation of drugs and targets using a graph convolutional networks-based model and predicts DTIs based on the learned features. During the training process, EEG-DTI learns the feature representation of nodes in an end-to-end mode. The evaluation test shows that EEG-DTI performs better than existing state-of-art methods.

SSI-DDI: Substructure-substructure interactions for drug-drug interaction prediction,"A major concern with co-administration of different drugs is the high risk of interference between their mechanisms of action, known as adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which can cause serious injuries to the organism. Although several computational methods have been proposed for identifying potential adverse DDIs, there is still room for improvement. Existing methods are not explicitly based on the knowledge that DDIs are fundamentally caused by chemical substructure interactions instead of whole drugs' chemical structures. Furthermore, most of existing methods rely on manually engineered molecular representation, which is limited by the domain expert's knowledge.We propose substructure-substructure interaction-drug-drug interaction (SSI-DDI), a deep learning framework, which operates directly on the raw molecular graph representations of drugs for richer feature extraction; and, most importantly, breaks the DDI prediction task between two drugs down to identifying pairwise interactions between their respective substructures. SSI-DDI is evaluated on real-world data and improves DDI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

DeepImmuno: Deep learning-empowered prediction and generation of immunogenic peptides for T-cell immunity,"Cytolytic T-cells play an essential role in the adaptive immune system by seeking out, binding and killing cells that present foreign antigens on their surface. An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press."
Self-Supervised Learning with Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for COVID-19 Drug Recommendation,"The emergence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have created an enormous socioeconomic impact. Although there are several promising drug candidates in clinical trials, none of them are approved yet. Thus, the drug repositioning approach may help to overcome the current pandemic. However, the sparse dataset of COVID-19 limits the accuracy of existing drug repositioning. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel drug repositioning framework (named Drug2Cov). Drug2Cov can learn an effective representation via integrating self-supervised learning with sparse data. Meanwhile, Drug2Cov uses a heterogeneous graph neural network to capture the complex interaction between viruses, targets, and drugs that enhance the accuracy of drug repositioning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed Drug2Cov framework.

DeepR2cov: deep representation learning on heterogeneous drug networks to discover anti-inflammatory agents for COVID-19,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the excessive inflammatory response is an important factor of death in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In this study, we propose a deep representation on heterogeneous drug networks, termed DeepR2cov, to discover potential agents for treating the excessive inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients. This work explores the multi-hub characteristic of a heterogeneous drug network integrating eight unique networks. Inspired by the multi-hub characteristic, we design 3 billion special meta paths to train a deep representation model for learning low-dimensional vectors that integrate long-range structure dependency and complex semantic relation among network nodes. Based on the representation vectors and transcriptomics data, we predict 22 drugs that bind to tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-6, whose therapeutic associations with the inflammation storm in COVID-19 patients, and molecular binding model are further validated via data from PubMed publications, ongoing clinical trials and a docking program. In addition, the results on five biomedical applications suggest that DeepR2cov significantly outperforms five existing representation approaches. In summary, DeepR2cov is a powerful network representation approach and holds the potential to accelerate treatment of the inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients.

"Predicting potential drug-drug interactions by integrating chemical, biological, phenotypic and network data","Background: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are one of the major concerns in drug discovery. Accurate prediction of potential DDIs can help to reduce unexpected interactions in the entire lifecycle of drugs, and are important for the drug safety surveillance. Results: Since many DDIs are not detected or observed in clinical trials, this work is aimed to predict unobserved or undetected DDIs. In this paper, we collect a variety of drug data that may influence drug-drug interactions, i.e., drug substructure data, drug target data, drug enzyme data, drug transporter data, drug pathway data, drug indication data, drug side effect data, drug off side effect data and known drug-drug interactions. We adopt three representative methods: the neighbor recommender method, the random walk method and the matrix perturbation method to build prediction models based on different data. Thus, we evaluate the usefulness of different information sources for the DDI prediction. Further, we present flexible frames of integrating different models with suitable ensemble rules, including weighted average ensemble rule and classifier ensemble rule, and develop ensemble models to achieve better performances. Conclusions: The experiments demonstrate that different data sources provide diverse information, and the DDI network based on known DDIs is one of most important information for DDI prediction. The ensemble methods can produce better performances than individual methods, and outperform existing state-of-the-art methods.

A multiple kernel learning algorithm for drug-target interaction prediction,"Background: Drug-target networks are receiving a lot of attention in late years, given its relevance for pharmaceutical innovation and drug lead discovery. Different in silico approaches have been proposed for the identification of new drug-target interactions, many of which are based on kernel methods. Despite technical advances in the latest years, these methods are not able to cope with large drug-target interaction spaces and to integrate multiple sources of biological information. Results: We propose KronRLS-MKL, which models the drug-target interaction problem as a link prediction task on bipartite networks. This method allows the integration of multiple heterogeneous information sources for the identification of new interactions, and can also work with networks of arbitrary size. Moreover, it automatically selects the more relevant kernels by returning weights indicating their importance in the drug-target prediction at hand. Empirical analysis on four data sets using twenty distinct kernels indicates that our method has higher or comparable predictive performance than 18 competing methods in all prediction tasks. Moreover, the predicted weights reflect the predictive quality of each kernel on exhaustive pairwise experiments, which indicates the success of the method to automatically reveal relevant biological sources. Conclusions: Our analysis show that the proposed data integration strategy is able to improve the quality of the predicted interactions, and can speed up the identification of new drug-target interactions as well as identify relevant information for the task.
