Title,Abstract
Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph Neural Network for Parkinson's Detection using Vertical Ground Reaction Force,"Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) signal obtained from foot-worn sensors, also known as plantar data, provides a highly informative and detailed representation of an individual's gait features. Existing methods, such as CNNs, LSTMs and Transformers, have revealed the efficiency of deep learning in Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis using VGRF signal. However, the intrinsic topologic graph and pressure transmission characteristics of plantar data are overlooked in those approaches, which are essential features for gait analysis. In this paper, we propose to construct a plantar directed topologic graph to fully exploit the plantar topology in gait circles. It can facilitate the expression of gait information by representing sensors as nodes and pressure transmissions as directional edges. Accordingly, an Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph Neural Network (AST-DGNN) is proposed to extract the connection features of the plantar directed topologic graph. Each AST-DGNN Unit includes an Adaptive Directed Graph Network (ADGN) block and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) block. In order to capture both local and global spatial relationships among sensor nodes and pressure transmission edges, the ADGN block performs message passing on the plantar directed topologic graph in an adaptive manner. To capture the temporal features of sensor nodes and pressure transmission edges, the TCN block defines a temporal feature extraction process for each node and edge in the graph. Moreover, the data augmentation is introduced for plantar data to improve the generalization ability of the AST-DGNN. Experimental results on Ga, Ju, and Si datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods under both cross-dataset validation and mixed-data cross-validation. Especially in cross-dataset validation, there is an average improvement of 2.13%, 7.73%, and 12.27% in accuracy, F1 score, and G-mean, respectively. © 2023 ACM."
Graph neural network based unsupervised influential sample selection for brain multigraph population fusion,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have witnessed remarkable proliferation due to the increasing number of applications where data is represented as graphs. GNN-based multigraph population fusion methods for estimating population representative connectional brain templates (CBT) have recently led to improvements, especially in network neuroscience. However, prior studies do not consider how an individual training brain multigraph influences the quality of GNN training for brain multigraph population fusion. To address this issue, we propose two major sample selection methods to quantify the influence of a training brain multigraph on the brain multigraph population fusion task using GNNs, in a fully unsupervised manner: (1) GraphGradIn, in which we use gradients w.r.t GNN weights to trace changes in the centeredness loss of connectional brain template during the training phase; (2) GraphTestIn, in which we exclude a training brain multigraph of interest during the refinement process in the test phase to infer its influence on the CBT centeredness loss. Next, we select the most influential multigraphs to build the training set for brain multigraph population fusion into a CBT. We conducted extensive experiments on brain multigraph datasets to show that using a dataset of influential training samples improves the learned connectional brain template in terms of centeredness, discriminativeness, and topological soundness. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our methods by discovering the connectional fingerprints of healthy and neurologically disordered brain multigraph populations including Alzheimer's disease and Autism spectrum disorder patients.

Federated Brain Graph Evolution Prediction Using Decentralized Connectivity Datasets With Temporally-Varying Acquisitions,"Foreseeing the evolution of brain connectivity between anatomical regions from a baseline observation can propel early disease diagnosis and clinical decision making. Such task becomes challenging when learning from multiple decentralized datasets with missing timepoints (e.g., datasets collected from different hospitals with a varying sequence of acquisitions). Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborative learning among multiple clients (i.e., hospitals) in a fully privacy-preserving fashion. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no FL work that foresees the time-dependent brain connectivity evolution from a single timepoint-let alone learning from non-iid decentralized longitudinal datasets with varying acquisition timepoints. In this paper, we propose the first FL framework to significantly boost the predictive performance of local hospitals with missing acquisition timepoints while benefiting from other hospitals with available data at those timepoints without sharing data. Specifically, we introduce 4D-FED-GNN+, a novel longitudinal federated GNN framework that works in (i) a uni-mode, where it acts as a graph self-encoder if the next timepoint is locally missing or (ii) in a dual-mode, where it concurrently acts as a graph generator and a self-encoder if the local follow-up data is available. Further, we propose a dual federation strategy, where (i) GNN layer-wise weight aggregation and (ii) pairwise GNN weight exchange between hospitals in a random order. To improve the performance of the poorly-conditioned hospitals (e.g., consecutive missing timepoints, intermediate missing timepoint), we further propose a second variant, namely 4D-FED-GNN++, which federates based on an ordering of the local hospitals computed using their incomplete sequential patterns. Our comprehensive experiments on real longitudinal datasets show that overall 4D-FED-GNN+ and 4D-FED-GNN++ significantly outperform benchmark methods.

Federated Multi-domain GNN Network for Brain Multigraph Generation,"Brain multigraph (i.e. multi-view or multi-domain) is a set of brain graphs also called brain connectomes, where each brain graph represents a unique view of pairwise relationships between brain regions (nodes) like morphology. Several works based on Graph Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been recently proposed to predict brain multigraph from a single graph with the aim of early detection of anomalous changes in the human brain connectome. However, such frameworks exhibit some drawbacks. First, there is a lack of generalisability, as they did not consider the case of predicting varying domains of brain graphs from a single domain as different hospitals may have different targets. Second, they merely consider data-sharing situations and build a robust model from the cooperation of different hospitals. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Multi-Domain GNN model (FMDGNN), which not only predicts multiple brain graphs with a varying number of domains from a single brain graph, but also preserves data privacy when different hospitals. Our core contributions are as follows: (i) We are the first to propose federated multi-domain GNN models for generating varying domains of brain graphs across hospitals while preserving data privacy. For instance, while hospital i can generate one domain, hospital j can generate a few domains (ii) We introduce a residual connection in the graph autoencoders to further improve the prediction performance. (iii) We propose and simplify a domain-specific GNN decoder to predict a specific brain graph domain and enhance the prediction efficiency. Our results outperform its variants, preserve data privacy and tackle statistical heterogeneity in non-IID data distribution across hospitals, thereby showing its potential in brain multigraph prediction with varying number of domains from a single graph.

Diagnosis of Glioblastoma Multiforme Progression via Interpretable Structure-Constrained Graph Neural Networks,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of brain tumors with high recurrence and mortality rates. After chemotherapy treatment, GBM patients still show a high rate of differentiating pseudoprogression (PsP), which is often confused as true tumor progression (TTP) due to high phenotypical similarities. Thus, it is crucial to construct an automated diagnosis model for differentiating between these two types of glioma progression. However, attaining this goal is impeded by the limited data availability and the high demand for interpretability in clinical settings. In this work, we propose an interpretable structure-constrained graph neural network (ISGNN) with enhanced features to automatically discriminate between PsP and TTP. This network employs a metric-based meta-learning strategy to aggregate class-specific graph nodes, focus on meta-tasks associated with various small graphs, thus improving the classification performance on small-scale datasets. Specifically, a node feature enhancement module is proposed to account for the relative importance of node features and enhance their distinguishability through inductive learning. A graph generation constraint module enables learning reasonable graph structures to improve the efficiency of information diffusion while avoiding propagation errors. Furthermore, model interpretability can be naturally enhanced based on the learned node features and graph structures that are closely related to the classification results. Comprehensive experimental evaluation of our method demonstrated excellent interpretable results in the diagnosis of glioma progression. In general, our work provides a novel systematic GNN approach for dealing with data scarcity and enhancing decision interpretability.

Leveraging patient similarities via graph neural networks to predict phenotypes from temporal data,"Several machine learning approaches have been proposed to automatically derive clinical phenotypes from patient data. Nevertheless, methods leveraging similarity-based patient networks remain underexplored for temporal data. In this work, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model that learns patient representation using different network configurations and feature modes. To explore the sequential nature of time series, features were extracted using a recurrent neural network (RNN) and embedded using information from the network structure via the GNN. Our method improves upon statistical and RNN baselines, with performance boosts up to 1% and 22% accuracy in the inductive and transductive settings, respectively. We also show that network configurations significantly impact performance in the transductive learning setting. Thus, automated phenotyping models based on GNNs could be used to support phenotype-based clinical research and ultimately for personalized clinical decision support.Data and Code Availability: This paper uses the MIMIC-III dataset [1], which is available on the PhysioNet repository [2].

HiGNN: A Hierarchical Informative Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction Equipped with Feature-Wise Attention,"Elucidating and accurately predicting the druggability and bioactivities of molecules plays a pivotal role in drug design and discovery and remains an open challenge. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have made remarkable advancements in graph-based molecular property prediction. However, current graph-based deep learning methods neglect the hierarchical information of molecules and the relationships between feature channels. In this study, we propose a well-designed hierarchical informative graph neural network (termed HiGNN) framework for predicting molecular property by utilizing a corepresentation learning of molecular graphs and chemically synthesizable breaking of retrosynthetically interesting chemical substructure (BRICS) fragments. Furthermore, a plug-and-play feature-wise attention block is first designed in HiGNN architecture to adaptively recalibrate atomic features after the message passing phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HiGNN achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance on many challenging drug discovery-associated benchmark data sets. In addition, we devise a molecule-fragment similarity mechanism to comprehensively investigate the interpretability of the HiGNN model at the subgraph level, indicating that HiGNN as a powerful deep learning tool can help chemists and pharmacists identify the key components of molecules for designing better molecules with desired properties or functions.

Federated Multi-trajectory GNNs Under Data Limitations for Baby Brain Connectivity Forecasting,"Building accurate predictive models to forecast the trajectory evolution of baby brain networks during the first postnatal year can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of early brain connectivity development. While emerging studies aimed to predict the evolution of brain graphs from a single observation, they suffer from two major limitations: (i) they typically rely on large training datasets to achieve satisfactory performance. However, longitudinal infant brain scans are costly and hard to acquire, and (ii) they adopt a uni-trajectory approach, lacking the ability to generalize to multi-trajectory prediction tasks, where each graph trajectory corresponds to a particular imaging modality (e.g., functional) and at a fixed resolution (graph size). To address these limitations, we propose FedGmTE-Net*, a federated graph-based multi-trajectory evolution network. Given a small dataset, we leverage the power of federation through collaborative model sharing among diverse hospitals. This approach not only enhances the performance of the local generative graph neural network (GNN) model of each hospital but also ensures the preservation of data privacy. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first federated learning framework designed for brain multi-trajectory evolution prediction. Further, to make the most of the limited data available at each hospital, we incorporate an auxiliary regularizer that modifies the local objective function, for more effective utilization of all the longitudinal brain connectivity in the evolution trajectory. This significantly improves the network performance. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FedGmTE-Net* outperforms benchmark methods by a substantial margin.

Exploiting Interactivity and Heterogeneity for Sleep Stage Classification Via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network,"Sleep stage classification based on physiological time-series is essential for sleep quality evaluation and the diagnosis of sleep disorders in clinical practice. Existing machine learning studies have achieved adequate results in sleep stage classification. However, those methods neglect the significance of simultaneously capturing the interactivity and heterogeneity of physiological signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Sleep Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (SleepHGNN) to employ these essential features. The SleepHGNN is a deep graph network consisting of Heterogeneous Graph Transformer layers, which are composed of a Heterogeneous Message Passing module for capturing the heterogeneity and a Target-Specific Aggregation module for capturing the interactivity of physiological signals. The experiments show that the SleepHGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the sleep stage classification task.

PredPS: Attention-based graph neural network for predicting stability of compounds in human plasma,"Stability of compounds in the human plasma is crucial for maintaining sufficient systemic drug exposure and considered an essential factor in the early stages of drug discovery and development. The rapid degradation of compounds in the plasma can result in poor in vivo efficacy. Currently, there are no open-source software programs for predicting human plasma stability. In this study, we developed an attention-based graph neural network, PredPS to predict the plasma stability of compounds in human plasma using in-house and open-source datasets. The PredPS outperformed the two machine learning and two deep learning algorithms that were used for comparison indicating its stability-predicting efficiency. PredPS achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.1%, accuracy of 83.5%, sensitivity of 82.3%, and specificity of 84.6% when evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. In the early stages of drug discovery, PredPS could be a helpful method for predicting the human plasma stability of compounds. Saving time and money can be accomplished by adopting an in silico-based plasma stability prediction model at the high-throughput screening stage.

Dual-stream encoder neural networks with spectral constraint for clustering functional brain connectivity data,"Functional brain connectivity data extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), characterized by high dimensionality and nonlinear structure, has been widely used to mine the organizational structure for different brain diseases. It is difficult to achieve effective performance by directly using these data for unsupervised clustering analysis of brain diseases. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a dual-stream encoder neural networks with spectral constraint framework for clustering the functional brain connectivity data. Specifically, we consider two different information while encoding the input data: (1) the information between the neighboring nodes, (2) the discriminative features, then design a spectral constraint module to guide the clustering of embedded nodes. The framework contains four modules, Graph Convolutional Encoder, Hard Assignment Optimization Network, Decoder module, and Spectral Constraint module. We train four modules jointly and implement a deep clustering network framework. We conducted experimental analysis on different public functional brain connectivity datasets for evaluating the proposed deep learning clustering model. Compared with the existing unsupervised clustering analysis methods for the brain connectivity data and related deep learning clustering methods, experiments on seven real brain connectivity datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/hulu88/DENs-SCC. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
Meta-RegGNN: Predicting Verbal and Full-Scale Intelligence Scores Using Graph Neural Networks and Meta-learning,"Decrypting intelligence from the human brain construct is vital in the detection of particular neurological disorders. Recently, functional brain connectomes have been used successfully to predict behavioral scores. However, state-of-the-art methods, on one hand, neglect the topological properties of the connectomes and, on the other hand, fail to solve the high inter-subject brain heterogeneity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel regression graph neural network through meta-learning namely Meta-RegGNN for predicting behavioral scores from brain connectomes. The parameters of our proposed regression GNN are explicitly trained so that a small number of gradient steps combined with a small training data amount produces a good generalization to unseen brain connectomes. Our results on verbal and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction outperform existing methods in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder cohorts. Furthermore, we show that our proposed approach ensures generalizability, particularly for autistic subjects.

Investigating the Predictive Reproducibility of Federated Graph Neural Networks Using Medical Datasets,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved extraordinary enhancements in various areas including the fields medical imaging and network neuroscience where they displayed a high accuracy in diagnosing challenging neurological disorders such as autism. In the face of medical data scarcity and high-privacy, training such data-hungry models remains challenging. Federated learning brings an efficient solution to this issue by allowing to train models on multiple datasets, collected independently by different hospitals, in fully data-preserving manner. Although both state-of-the-art GNNs and federated learning techniques focus on boosting classification accuracy, they overlook a critical unsolved problem: investigating the reproducibility of the most discriminative biomarkers (i.e., features) selected by the GNN models within a federated learning paradigm. Quantifying the reproducibility of a predictive medical model against perturbations of training and testing data distributions presents one of the biggest hurdles to overcome in developing translational clinical applications. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first work investigating the reproducibility of federated GNN models with application to classifying medical imaging and brain connectivity datasets. We evaluated our framework using various GNN models trained on medical imaging and connectomic datasets. More importantly, we showed that federated learning boosts both the accuracy and reproducibility of GNN models in such medical learning tasks.

XGraphBoost: Extracting Graph Neural Network-Based Features for a Better Prediction of Molecular Properties,"Determining the properties of chemical molecules is essential for screening candidates similar to a specific drug. These candidate molecules are further evaluated for their target binding affinities, side effects, target missing probabilities, etc. Conventional machine learning algorithms demonstrated satisfying prediction accuracies of molecular properties. A molecule cannot be directly loaded into a machine learning model, and a set of engineered features needs to be designed and calculated from a molecule. Such hand-crafted features rely heavily on the experiences of the investigating researchers. The concept of graph neural networks (GNNs) was recently introduced to describe the chemical molecules. The features may be automatically and objectively extracted from the molecules through various types of GNNs, e.g., GCN (graph convolution network), GGNN (gated graph neural network), DMPNN (directed message passing neural network), etc. However, the training of a stable GNN model requires a huge number of training samples and a large amount of computing power, compared with the conventional machine learning strategies. This study proposed the integrated framework XGraphBoost to extract the features using a GNN and build an accurate prediction model of molecular properties using the classifier XGBoost. The proposed framework XGraphBoost fully inherits the merits of the GNN-based automatic molecular feature extraction and XGBoost-based accurate prediction performance. Both classification and regression problems were evaluated using the framework XGraphBoost. The experimental results strongly suggest that XGraphBoost may facilitate the efficient and accurate predictions of various molecular properties.

A representation learning model based on variational inference and graph autoencoder for predicting lncRNA-disease associations,"Background: Numerous studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs are related to plenty of human diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations for disease prognosis, diagnosis and therapy. Dozens of machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been adopted to this problem, yet it is still challenging to learn efficient low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional features of lncRNAs and diseases to predict unknown lncRNA-disease associations accurately. Results: We proposed an end-to-end model, VGAELDA, which integrates variational inference and graph autoencoders for lncRNA-disease associations prediction. VGAELDA contains two kinds of graph autoencoders. Variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) infer representations from features of lncRNAs and diseases respectively, while graph autoencoders propagate labels via known lncRNA-disease associations. These two kinds of autoencoders are trained alternately by adopting variational expectation maximization algorithm. The integration of both the VGAE for graph representation learning, and the alternate training via variational inference, strengthens the capability of VGAELDA to capture efficient low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional features, and hence promotes the robustness and preciseness for predicting unknown lncRNA-disease associations. Further analysis illuminates that the designed co-training framework of lncRNA and disease for VGAELDA solves a geometric matrix completion problem for capturing efficient low-dimensional representations via a deep learning approach. Conclusion: Cross validations and numerical experiments illustrate that VGAELDA outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in lncRNA-disease association prediction. Case studies indicate that VGAELDA is capable of detecting potential lncRNA-disease associations.

A graph auto-encoder model for miRNA-disease associations prediction,"Emerging evidence indicates that the abnormal expression of miRNAs involves in the evolution and progression of various human complex diseases. Identifying disease-related miRNAs as new biomarkers can promote the development of disease pathology and clinical medicine. However, designing biological experiments to validate disease-related miRNAs is usually time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is urgent to design effective computational methods for predicting potential miRNA-disease associations. Inspired by the great progress of graph neural networks in link prediction, we propose a novel graph auto-encoder model, named GAEMDA, to identify the potential miRNA-disease associations in an end-to-end manner. More specifically, the GAEMDA model applies a graph neural networks-based encoder, which contains aggregator function and multi-layer perceptron for aggregating nodes' neighborhood information, to generate the low-dimensional embeddings of miRNA and disease nodes and realize the effective fusion of heterogeneous information. Then, the embeddings of miRNA and disease nodes are fed into a bilinear decoder to identify the potential links between miRNA and disease nodes. The experimental results indicate that GAEMDA achieves the average area under the curve of 93.56 ± 0.44% under 5-fold cross-validation. Besides, we further carried out case studies on colon neoplasms, esophageal neoplasms and kidney neoplasms. As a result, 48 of the top 50 predicted miRNAs associated with these diseases are confirmed by the database of differentially expressed miRNAs in human cancers and microRNA deregulation in human disease database, respectively. The satisfactory prediction performance suggests that GAEMDA model could serve as a reliable tool to guide the following researches on the regulatory role of miRNAs.

Identification of plant vacuole proteins by exploiting deep representation learning features,"Plant vacuoles are the most important organelles for plant growth, development, and defense, and they play an important role in many types of stress responses. An important function of vacuole proteins is the transport of various classes of amino acids, ions, sugars, and other molecules. Accurate identification of vacuole proteins is crucial for revealing their biological functions. Several automatic and rapid computational tools have been proposed for the subcellular localization of proteins. Regrettably, they are not specific for the identification of plant vacuole proteins. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one computational software specifically trained for plant vacuolar proteins. Although its accuracy is acceptable, the prediction performance and stability of this method in practical applications can still be improved. Hence, in this study, a new predictor named iPVP-DRLF was developed to identify plant vacuole proteins specifically and effectively. This prediction software is designed using the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) algorithm and hybrid features composed of classic sequence features and deep representation learning features. iPVP-DRLF achieved fivefold cross-validation and independent test accuracy values of 88.25 % and 87.16 %, respectively, both outperforming previous state-of-the-art predictors. Moreover, the blind dataset test results also showed that the performance of iPVP-DRLF was significantly better than the existing tools. The results of comparative experiments confirmed that deep representation learning features have an advantage over other classic sequence features in the identification of plant vacuole proteins. We believe that iPVP-DRLF would serve as an effective computational technique for plant vacuole protein prediction and facilitate related future research.

TrimNet: Learning molecular representation from triplet messages for biomedicine,"Motivation: Computational methods accelerate drug discovery and play an important role in biomedicine, such as molecular property prediction and compound-protein interaction (CPI) identification. A key challenge is to learn useful molecular representation. In the early years, molecular properties are mainly calculated by quantum mechanics or predicted by traditional machine learning methods, which requires expert knowledge and is often labor-intensive. Nowadays, graph neural networks have received significant attention because of the powerful ability to learn representation from graph data. Nevertheless, current graph-based methods have some limitations that need to be addressed, such as large-scale parameters and insufficient bond information extraction. Results: In this study, we proposed a graph-based approach and employed a novel triplet message mechanism to learn molecular representation efficiently, named triplet message networks (TrimNet). We show that TrimNet can accurately complete multiple molecular representation learning tasks with significant parameter reduction, including the quantum properties, bioactivity, physiology and CPI prediction. In the experiments, TrimNet outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin on various datasets. Besides the few parameters and high prediction accuracy, TrimNet could focus on the atoms essential to the target properties, providing a clear interpretation of the prediction tasks. These advantages have established TrimNet as a powerful and useful computational tool in solving the challenging problem of molecular representation learning.

Interpretable temporal graph neural network for prognostic prediction of Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal neuroimaging data,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. Early detection and accurate prognosis of AD is an important research topic, and numerous machine learning methods have been proposed to solve this problem. However, traditional machine learning models are facing challenges in effectively integrating longitudinal neuroimaging data and biologically meaningful structure and knowledge to build accurate and interpretable prognostic predictors. To bridge this gap, we propose an interpretable graph neural network (GNN) model for AD prognostic prediction based on longitudinal neuroimaging data while embracing the valuable knowledge of structural brain connectivity. In our empirical study, we demonstrate that 1) the proposed model outperforms several competing models (i.e., DNN, SVM) in terms of prognostic prediction accuracy, and 2) our model can capture neuroanatomical contribution to the prognostic predictor and yield biologically meaningful interpretation to facilitate better mechanistic understanding of the Alzheimer's disease.

One Representative-Shot Learning Using a Population-Driven Template with Application to Brain Connectivity Classification and Evolution Prediction,"Few-shot learning presents a challenging paradigm for training discriminative models on a few training samples representing the target classes to discriminate. However, classification methods based on deep learning are ill-suited for such learning as they need large amounts of training data –let alone one-shot learning. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been introduced to the field of network neuroscience, where the brain connectivity is encoded in a graph. However, with scarce neuroimaging datasets particularly for rare diseases and low-resource clinical facilities, such data-devouring architectures might fail in learning the target task. In this paper, we take a very different approach in training GNNs, where we aim to learn with one sample and achieve the best performance –a formidable challenge to tackle. Specifically, we present the first one-shot paradigm where a GNN is trained on a single population-driven template –namely a connectional brain template (CBT). A CBT is a compact representation of a population of brain graphs capturing the unique connectivity patterns shared across individuals. It is analogous to brain image atlases for neuroimaging datasets. Using a one-representative CBT as a training sample, we alleviate the training load of GNN models while boosting their performance across a variety of classification and regression tasks. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperformed benchmark one-shot learning methods with downstream classification and time-dependent brain graph data forecasting tasks while competing with the “train on all” conventional training strategy.

Deep Learning Predicts Protein-Ligand Interactions,"This paper presents results from a rapid-response industry-academia collaboration for virtual screening of chemical, natural and virtual drug ligands towards identifying potential therapeutics for COVID-19. Compared to resource-intensive traditional approaches of either conducting high- throughput screening in a lab or in-silico molecular dynamics simulations on supercomputers, we have developed an open- source framework that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately and quickly predict the binding potential of a drug ligand with a target protein. We have trained a novel molecular-highway graph neural network architecture using the entirety of the BindingDB database to predict the probability of a drug ligand binding to a protein target. Our approach achieves a prodigious 98.3% accuracy with its predictions. Through this paper, we disseminate our source code and use the AI model to screen both public (ChEMBL, DrugBank) and proprietary databases. Compared to other AI-based methods, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the following metrics - (i) number of molecules currently undergoing active clinical trials, (ii) number of antiviral drugs correctly identified, (iii) accuracy despite not needing active-site priors, and (iv) ability to screen more compounds in unit time. © 2020 IEEE."
A self-attention based message passing neural network for predicting molecular lipophilicity and aqueous solubility,"Efficient and accurate prediction of molecular properties, such as lipophilicity and solubility, is highly desirable for rational compound design in chemical and pharmaceutical industries. To this end, we build and apply a graph-neural-network framework called self-attention-based message-passing neural network (SAMPN) to study the relationship between chemical properties and structures in an interpretable way. The main advantages of SAMPN are that it directly uses chemical graphs and breaks the black-box mold of many machine/deep learning methods. Specifically, its attention mechanism indicates the degree to which each atom of the molecule contributes to the property of interest, and these results are easily visualized. Further, SAMPN outperforms random forests and the deep learning framework MPN from Deepchem. In addition, another formulation of SAMPN (Multi-SAMPN) can simultaneously predict multiple chemical properties with higher accuracy and efficiency than other models that predict one specific chemical property. Moreover, SAMPN can generate chemically visible and interpretable results, which can help researchers discover new pharmaceuticals and materials.

SNAVI: Desktop application for analysis and visualization of large-scale signaling networks,"Background: Studies of cellular signaling indicate that signal transduction pathways combine to form large networks of interactions. Viewing protein-protein and ligand-protein interactions as graphs (networks), where biomolecules are represented as nodes and their interactions are represented as links, is a promising approach for integrating experimental results from different sources to achieve a systematic understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving cell phenotype. The emergence of large-scale signaling networks provides an opportunity for topological statistical analysis while visualization of such networks represents a challenge.
