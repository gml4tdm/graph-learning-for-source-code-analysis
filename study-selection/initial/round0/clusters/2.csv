Title,Abstract
Dynamic attention augmented graph network for video accident anticipation,"Accident anticipation (or the prediction of abnormal events in general) aims to forecast accidents before they occur by assessing risks based on the preceding frames in videos. The risk assessment heavily relies on understanding the semantics of the scene context and predicting the interactions among the involved subjects. Indeed, the comprehensive utilization of spatial relationships among the subjects of immediate interest in a single frame and temporal dependencies across consecutive frames is crucial for video accident anticipation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Attention Augmented Graph Network (DAA-GNN), which leverages underlying spatial cues and models’ relationships among detected subjects of immediate interest. Specifically, our approach employs a graph neural network that is enhanced by global context clues, allowing effective message propagation and the discovery of interactions among the subjects of interest in the scene. The DAA-GNN includes a temporal attention module designed to identify long-term dependencies along the temporal axis, contributing to an end-to-end deep network solution for accurate accident anticipation. We extensively evaluate our method on the publicly available Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD) and Epic Fail (EF) datasets, by conducting comprehensive experiments to assess its performance. The results unequivocally demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art accident anticipation methods.

Parking Prediction in Smart Cities: A Survey,"With the growing number of cars in cities, smart parking is gradually becoming a strategic issue in building a smart city. As the precondition in smart parking, accurate parking prediction can reduce the time drivers spend searching for parking spaces and relieve traffic congestion. Meanwhile, VANET and the Internet-of-things (IoT) are the key elements of the current intelligent transportation system. With the IoT devices based on VANET becoming more extensively employed, a large amount of parking data is generated every day, and various methods are proposed for parking prediction, therefore, it is time to systematically summarize the parking prediction issues and the state-of-the-art prediction methods. In this survey, we first provide a comprehensive review of the existing methods used for parking prediction ranging from conventional statistical methods to the latest graph neural network methods. Then, we classify a variety of parking problems such as parking availability prediction, parking behavior prediction, and parking demand prediction. We also compile all the evaluation metrics, open data, and open-source code of the surveyed literature. Finally, we present the challenges and future directions of the parking prediction technique. As far as we know, this is the first survey exploring parking prediction methods, which will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners engaging in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and smart cities.  © 2000-2011 IEEE."
HiGRN: A Hierarchical Graph Recurrent Network for Global Sea Surface Temperature Prediction,"Sea surface temperature (SST) is one critical parameter of global climate change, and accurate SST prediction is important to various applications, e.g., weather forecasting, fishing directions, and disaster warnings. The global ocean system is unified and complex, and the SST patterns in different oceanic regions are highly diverse and correlated. However, existing data-driven SST prediction methods mainly consider the local patterns within a certain oceanic region, e.g., El Nino region and the Black sea. It is challenging but necessary to model the global SST correlations rather than that in a specific region to enhance the prediction accuracy of SST. In this work, we proposed a new method called Hierarchical Graph Recurrent Network (HiGRN) to address the issue. First, to learn the dynamic and diverse local SST patterns of specific locations, we design an adaptive node embedding with self-learned parameters to learn various SST patterns. Then we develop a hierarchical cluster generator to aggregate the locations with similar patterns into regional clusters and utilize a graph convolution network to learn the spatial correlations among these clusters. Finally, we introduce a multi-level attention mechanism to fuse the local patterns and regional correlations, and the output is fed into a recurrent network to achieve SST predictions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art SST prediction methods.

Crime prediction with graph neural networks and multivariate normal distributions,"We study high-resolution crime prediction and introduce a new generative model applicable to any spatiotemporal data with graph convolutional gated recurrent units (Graph-ConvGRU) and multivariate Gaussian distributions. We introduce a subdivision algorithm and create a graph representation to tackle the sparsity and complexity problem in high-resolution spatiotemporal data. By leveraging the flexible structure of graph representation, we model the spatial, temporal, and categorical relations of crime events and produce state vectors for each region. We create a multivariate probability distribution from the state vectors and train the distributions by minimizing the KL divergence between the generated and the actual distribution of the crime events. After creating the distributions, crime can be predicted in any resolution as the first time in the literature. In our experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets, our model obtains the best score with respect to the state-of-the-art models with statistically significant improvements. Hence, our model is not only generative but also precise. We also provide the source code of our algorithm for reproducibility. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
Automated Dilated Spatio-Temporal Synchronous Graph Modeling for Traffic Prediction,"Accurate traffic prediction is a challenging task in intelligent transportation systems because of the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in transportation networks. Many existing works utilize sophisticated temporal modeling approaches to incorporate with graph convolution networks (GCNs) for capturing short-term and long-term spatio-temporal dependencies. However, these separated modules with complicated designs could restrict effectiveness and efficiency of spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, most previous works adopt the fixed graph construction methods to characterize the global spatio-temporal relations, which limits the learning capability of the model for different time periods and even different data scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose an automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous graph network, named Auto-DSTSGN for traffic prediction. Specifically, we design an automated dilated spatio-temporal synchronous graph (Auto-DSTSG) module to capture the short-term and long-term spatio-temporal correlations by stacking deeper layers with dilation factors in an increasing order. Further, we propose a graph structure search approach to automatically construct the spatio-temporal synchronous graph that can adapt to different data scenarios. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve about 10% improvements compared with the state-of-art methods.

Predicting influenza with pandemic-awareness via Dynamic Virtual Graph Significance Networks,"Every year, influenza spreads worldwide and burdens people's health substantially. We need a reliable model to help hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and governments better prepare for influenza outbreaks in a timely manner. However, the domain knowledge for such public health events, such as the variable influenza seasonality and occasional pandemics, poses significant challenges in predicting influenza outbreaks. The existing methods use current and historical values in a user-defined time window as input to predict future values but lack considering the situations outside the window. To address these limitations, we proposed Dynamic Virtual Graph Significance Networks (DVGSN). The graph-based algorithm can supervisedly and dynamically learn the implied knowledge from similar “infection situations” in all the historical timepoints without the limitation of time window. Furthermore, representation learning on the dynamic virtual graph can tackle the varied seasonality with pandemic-awareness without requiring domain knowledge input. The extensive experiments on real-world influenza data demonstrate that DVGSN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to supervisedly learn a dynamic virtual graph for time-series prediction tasks. Moreover, the proposed method has rich interpretabilities, which makes the method more acceptable in the fields of public health, life sciences, and so on.

Adaptive Spatiotemporal InceptionNet for Traffic Flow Forecasting,"Traffic flow forecasting is crucial to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), particularly for route planning and traffic management. Spatiotemporal graph neural networks have been widely used for this purpose, where a global graph structure is mainly used, but local graph features are ignored. Multi-scale spatiotemporal features - the combined application of global and local graph features - can help effectively discover the underlying spatiotemporal patterns. This study proposed a multi-scale adaptive spatiotemporal forecasting model called Adaptive SpatioTemporal InceptionNet (AST-InceptionNet). To enrich the captured features and extract multi-scale spatiotemporal ones, the inception part is applied to combine local spatiotemporal features with several global ones. Additionally, we developed a fully adaptive graph convolution method, including topologically adaptive graph convolution and an adaptive adjacency matrix. It can autonomously and dynamically learn spatial heterogeneity and enable the proposed model to work with unknown adjacency relations. The proficiency of AST-InceptionNet was validated using four publicly available real-world traffic flow datasets. The experiments demonstrate a satisfactory performance from the proposed model, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by up to approximately 12%.  © 2000-2011 IEEE."
Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Prediction: Benchmark and Solution,"Traffic prediction is the cornerstone of intelligent transportation system. Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for the applications of smart cities, i.e., intelligent traffic management and urban planning. Although various methods are proposed for spatio-temporal modeling, they ignore the dynamic characteristics of correlations among locations on road network. Meanwhile, most Recurrent Neural Network based works are not efficient enough due to their recurrent operations. Additionally, there is a severe lack of fair comparison among different methods on the same datasets. To address the above challenges, in this article, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework, named Dynamic Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DGCRN). In DGCRN, hyper-networks are designed to leverage and extract dynamic characteristics from node attributes, while the parameters of dynamic filters are generated at each time step. We filter the node embeddings and then use them to generate dynamic graph, which is integrated with pre-defined static graph. As far as we know, we are first to employ a generation method to model fine topology of dynamic graph at each time step. Furthermore, to enhance efficiency and performance, we employ a training strategy for DGCRN by restricting the iteration number of decoder during forward and backward propagation. Finally, a reproducible standardized benchmark and a brand new representative traffic dataset are opened for fair comparison and further research. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms 15 baselines consistently.

Graph neural network for traffic forecasting: A survey,"Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. Deep learning models, including convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have been extensively applied in traffic forecasting problems to model spatial and temporal dependencies. In recent years, to model the graph structures in transportation systems as well as contextual information, graph neural networks have been introduced and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a series of traffic forecasting problems. In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source codes for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems. We have also created a public GitHub repository where the latest papers, open data, and source codes will be updated. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
KST-GCN: A Knowledge-Driven Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting,"While considering the spatial and temporal features of traffic, capturing the impacts of various external factors on travel is an essential step towards achieving accurate traffic forecasting. However, existing studies seldom consider external factors or neglect the effect of the complex correlations among external factors on traffic. Intuitively, knowledge graphs can naturally describe these correlations. Since knowledge graphs and traffic networks are essentially heterogeneous networks, it is challenging to integrate the information in both networks. On this background, this study presents a knowledge representation-driven traffic forecasting method based on spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks. We first construct a knowledge graph for traffic forecasting and derive knowledge representations by a knowledge representation learning method named KR-EAR. Then, we propose the Knowledge Fusion Cell (KF-Cell) to combine the knowledge and traffic features as the input of a spatial-temporal graph convolutional backbone network. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our strategy enhances the forecasting performances of backbones at various prediction horizons. The ablation and perturbation analysis further verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that constructs and utilizes a knowledge graph to facilitate traffic forecasting; it also offers a promising direction to integrate external information and spatial-temporal information for traffic forecasting.

How to Build a Graph-Based Deep Learning Architecture in Traffic Domain: A Survey,"In recent years, various deep learning architectures have been proposed to solve complex challenges (e.g. spatial dependency, temporal dependency) in traffic domain, which have achieved satisfactory performance. These architectures are composed of multiple deep learning techniques in order to tackle various challenges in traffic tasks. Traditionally, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to model spatial dependency by decomposing the traffic network as grids. However, many traffic networks are graph-structured in nature. In order to utilize such spatial information fully, it's more appropriate to formulate traffic networks as graphs mathematically. Recently, various novel deep learning techniques have been developed to process graph data, called graph neural networks (GNNs). More and more works combine GNNs with other deep learning techniques to construct an architecture dealing with various challenges in a complex traffic task, where GNNs are responsible for extracting spatial correlations in traffic network. These graph-based architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance. To provide a comprehensive and clear picture of such emerging trend, this survey carefully examines various graph-based deep learning architectures in many traffic applications. We first give guidelines to formulate a traffic problem based on graph and construct graphs from various kinds of traffic datasets. Then we decompose these graph-based architectures to discuss their shared deep learning techniques, clarifying the utilization of each technique in traffic tasks. What's more, we summarize some common traffic challenges and the corresponding graph-based deep learning solutions to each challenge. Finally, we provide benchmark datasets, open source codes and future research directions in this rapidly growing field.  © 2000-2011 IEEE."
Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Extended Multi-component Graph Convolutional Network,"Traffic flow prediction is always considered to be a challenging task due to the complex periodicity of traffic flow data, the dynamic nature of real-time change and the spatial-temporal dependence of road network. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a new traffic flow prediction model based on Extended Multi-component Graph Convolutional Network (EMGCN), which solves the problem that the existing traffic flow prediction methods are not sufficient to extract spatial-temporal features. Specifically, we introduce extended multi-component module to extract periodic temporal diffusion information of traffic flow. Then, the encoder consists of gated recurrent unit and graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal features of traffic flow, and finally converts the spatial-temporal features into future prediction sequences through the decoder. Extensive experiments are carried out on the public traffic datasets PEMSD8, and the experimental results show that the proposed model achieves the best results in all aspects.  © 2022 IEEE."
Spatial-Temporal Attention Network for Crime Prediction with Adaptive Graph Learning,"It is important but challenging to accurately predict urban crimes. Existing studies rely on domain knowledge specific, pre-defined inter-dependency graphs using extra urban data and have many disadvantages. We propose a novel framework, AGL-STAN, to efficiently capture complex spatial-temporal correlations of urban crimes with higher prediction accuracy but without extra data. In AGL-STAN, we design an adaptive graph learning method to learn the inter-dependencies among communities, and a time-aware self-attention method to accurately model the influence of time-varying crime incidents with a multi-head attention mechanism. We demonstrate the superiority of AGL-STAN over the state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Boosting house price predictions using geo-spatial network embedding,"Real estate contributes significantly to all major economies around the world. In particular, house prices have a direct impact on stakeholders, ranging from house buyers to financing companies. Thus, a plethora of techniques have been developed for real estate price prediction. Most of the existing techniques rely on different house features to build a variety of prediction models to predict house prices. Perceiving the effect of spatial dependence on house prices, some later works focused on introducing spatial regression models for improving prediction performance. However, they fail to take into account the geo-spatial context of the neighborhood amenities such as how close a house is to a train station, or a highly-ranked school, or a shopping center. Such contextual information may play a vital role in users’ interests in a house and thereby has a direct influence on its price. In this paper, we propose to leverage the concept of graph neural networks to capture the geo-spatial context of the neighborhood of a house. In particular, we present a novel method, the geo-spatial network embedding (GSNE), that learns the embeddings of houses and various types of points of interest (POIs) in the form of multipartite networks, where the houses and the POIs are represented as attributed nodes and the relationships between them as edges. Extensive experiments with a large number of regression techniques show that the embeddings produced by our proposed GSNE technique consistently and significantly improve the performance of the house price prediction task regardless of the downstream regression model.

CRAT-Pred: Vehicle Trajectory Prediction with Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Head Self-Attention,"Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is essential for autonomous vehicles, as it governs their own motion plan. Current state-of-the-art vehicle prediction models heavily rely on map information. In reality, however, this information is not always available. We therefore propose CRAT-Pred, a multi-modal and non-rasterization-based trajectory prediction model, specifically designed to effectively model social interactions between vehicles, without relying on map information. CRAT-Pred applies a graph convolution method originating from the field of material science to vehicle prediction, allowing to efficiently leverage edge features, and combines it with multi-head self-attention. Compared to other map-free approaches, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significantly lower number of model parameters. In addition to that, we quantitatively show that the self-attention mechanism is able to learn social interactions between vehicles, with the weights representing a measurable interaction score.

AST-GNN: An attention-based spatio-temporal graph neural network for Interaction-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction,"Predicting pedestrian trajectories in the future is a basic research topic in many real applications, such as video surveillance, self-driving cars, and robotic systems. There are two major challenges in this task, the complex interaction modeling among pedestrians and the unique motion pattern extraction for each pedestrian. Regarding the two challenges, an attention-based interaction-aware spatio-temporal graph neural network is proposed for predicting pedestrian trajectories. There are two components in the proposed method: spatial graph neural network for interaction modeling, and temporal graph neural network for motion feature extraction. Spatial graph neural network uses an attention mechanism to capture the spatial interactions among all the pedestrians at each time step. Meanwhile, temporal graph neural network uses an attention mechanism to capture the temporal motion pattern of each pedestrian. Finally, a time-extrapolator convolutional neural network is used in the temporal dimension of the aggregated graph features to predict the future trajectories. Experimental results on two benchmark pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate the competitive performances of the proposed method in terms of both the final displace error and the average displacement error metrics as compared with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
tcc2vec: RFM-informed representation learning on call graphs for churn prediction,"Applying social network analytics for telco churn prediction has become indispensable for almost a decade. However, in the current literature, the uptake does not reflect in a significantly increased leverage of the available information that these networks convey. First, network featurization in general is a very cumbersome process due to the complex nature of networks and the lack of a respective methodology. This results in ad hoc approaches and hand-crafted features. Second, deriving certain structural features in very large graphs is computationally expensive and, as a consequence, often neglected. Third, call networks are mostly treated as static in spite of their inherently dynamic nature. In this study, we propose tcc2vec, a panoptic approach aiming at devising representation learning (to address the first problem) on enriched call networks that integrate interaction and structural information (to overcome the second problem), which are being sliced in different time periods in order to account for different temporal granularities (hence addressing the third problem). In an extensive experimental analysis, insights are provided regarding an optimal choice of interaction and temporal granularities, as well as representation learning parameters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."
A Survey on Causal Inference,"Causal inference is a critical research topic across many domains, such as statistics, computer science, education, public policy, and economics, for decades. Nowadays, estimating causal effect from observational data has become an appealing research direction owing to the large amount of available data and low budget requirement, compared with randomized controlled trials. Embraced with the rapidly developed machine learning area, various causal effect estimation methods for observational data have sprung up. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of causal inference methods under the potential outcome framework, one of the well-known causal inference frameworks. The methods are divided into two categories depending on whether they require all three assumptions of the potential outcome framework or not. For each category, both the traditional statistical methods and the recent machine learning enhanced methods are discussed and compared. The plausible applications of these methods are also presented, including the applications in advertising, recommendation, medicine, and so on. Moreover, the commonly used benchmark datasets as well as the open-source codes are also summarized, which facilitate researchers and practitioners to explore, evaluate and apply the causal inference methods. © 2021 ACM."
TrafficStream: A Streaming Traffic Flow Forecasting Framework Based on Graph Neural Networks and Continual Learning,"With the rapid growth of traffic sensors deployed, a massive amount of traffic flow data are collected, revealing the long-term evolution of traffic flows and the gradual expansion of traffic networks. How to accurately forecasting these traffic flow attracts the attention of researchers as it is of great significance for improving the efficiency of transportation systems. However, existing methods mainly focus on the spatial-temporal correlation of static networks, leaving the problem of efficiently learning models on networks with expansion and evolving patterns less studied. To tackle this problem, we propose a Streaming Traffic Flow Forecasting Framework, TrafficStream, based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Continual Learning (CL), achieving accurate predictions and high efficiency. Firstly, we design a traffic pattern fusion method, cleverly integrating the new patterns that emerged during the long-term period into the model. A JS-divergence-based algorithm is proposed to mine new traffic patterns. Secondly, we introduce CL to consolidate the knowledge learned previously and transfer them to the current model. Specifically, we adopt two strategies: historical data replay and parameter smoothing. We construct a streaming traffic dataset to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent potential to extract traffic patterns with high efficiency on long-term streaming network scene.

The Prediction of Multistep Traffic Flow Based on AST-GCN-LSTM,"Aiming at the traffic flow prediction problem of the traffic network, this paper proposes a multistep traffic flow prediction model based on attention-based spatial-temporal-graph neural network-long short-term memory neural network (AST-GCN-LSTM). The model can capture the complex spatial dependence of road nodes on the road network and use LSGC (local spectrogram convolution) to capture spatial correlation features from the K-order local neighbors of the road segment nodes in the road network. It is more accurate to extract the information of neighbor nodes by replacing the single-hop neighborhood matrix with K-order local neighborhoods to expand the receptive field of graph convolution. The high-order neighborhood of road nodes is also fully considered instead of only extracting features from first-order neighbor nodes. In addition, an external attribute enhancement unit is designed to extract external factors (weather, point of interest, time, etc.) that affect traffic flow in order to improve the accuracy of the model's traffic flow prediction. The experimental results show that when considering the static, dynamic, and static and dynamic combination, the model has excellent performance: RMSE (4.0406, 4.0362, 4.0234), MAE (2.7184, 2.7044, 2.7030), accuracy (0.7132, 0.7190, 0.7223). © 2021 Fan Hou et al."
Spatial-temporal Structures of Deep Learning Models for Traffic Flow Forecasting: A Survey,"Traffic forecasting is important for the success of intelligent transportation systems. In recent years, deep learning methods, such as convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks and graph neural networks are introduced to model the spatial and temporal dependencies of the traffic data and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, the traffic flow forecasting models based on deep learning are summarized from the perspective of spatial and temporal structure design. Specifically, the existing models can be divided into combinatorial and integrative structures, where the spatial and temporal submodules are considered stepwise with the combinatorial mode but considered comprehensively as a whole with the integrative mode. The functions and structures of each submodule are described and summarized in detail, and the combined mode of the submodules is analyzed as well. On the other hand, the integrative pattern is discussed with two model design paradigms. Furthermore, this paper summarizes the open data sets and source code of the surveyed papers to help upcoming researchers. Finally, the challenges and prospect research directions are discussed thoroughly so as to inspire for more accurate and efficient models development. © 2021 IEEE."
QoS Prediction for Web Services via Combining Multi-component Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering and Deep Factorization Machine,"QoS prediction for Web Services is becoming increasingly important for various QoS-aware Web Services management tasks. However, the existing methods for QoS prediction of Web Services have some drawbacks, such as poor performance in dealing with data sparsity, insufficient consideration of latent information in user-service interaction behavior, and no consideration on discriminating the weight of latent information. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a QoS Prediction approach via combining multi-component graph convolutional collaborative filtering and deep factorization machine. A user-service bipartite graph is constructed, and the edges of the graph are decomposed into multiple latent spaces with node-level attention to identify latent components. Then, the importances of latent components are determined, and they are aggregated to obtain the corresponding user-service embedding vectors. Finally, the embedding vectors are taken as the input of a deep factorization machines model to obtain the prediction of unknown QoS. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that MGCCF-DFM achieves superior prediction accuracy in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the existing QoS prediction techniques. © 2021 IEEE."
CoANet: Connectivity Attention Network for Road Extraction from Satellite Imagery,"Extracting roads from satellite imagery is a promising approach to update the dynamic changes of road networks efficiently and timely. However, it is challenging due to the occlusions caused by other objects and the complex traffic environment, the pixel-based methods often generate fragmented roads and fail to predict topological correctness. In this paper, motivated by the road shapes and connections in the graph network, we propose a connectivity attention network (CoANet) to jointly learn the segmentation and pair-wise dependencies. Since the strip convolution is more aligned with the shape of roads, which are long-span, narrow, and distributed continuously. We develop a strip convolution module (SCM) that leverages four strip convolutions to capture long-range context information from different directions and avoid interference from irrelevant regions. Besides, considering the occlusions in road regions caused by buildings and trees, a connectivity attention module (CoA) is proposed to explore the relationship between neighboring pixels. The CoA module incorporates the graphical information and enables the connectivity of roads are better preserved. Extensive experiments on the popular benchmarks (SpaceNet and DeepGlobe datasets) demonstrate that our proposed CoANet establishes new state-of-the-art results.

An Attention-Based Interaction-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network for Trajectory Prediction,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction in crowd scenes is very useful in many applications such as video surveillance, self-driving cars, and robotic systems; however, it remains a challenging task because of the complex interactions and uncertainties of crowd motions. In this paper, a novel trajectory prediction method called the Attention-based Interaction-aware Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Network (AST-GNN) is proposed. AST-GNN uses an Attention mechanism to capture the complex interactions among multiple pedestrians. The attention mechanism allows for a dynamic and adaptive summary of the interactions of the nearby pedestrians. When the attention matrix is obtained, it is formulated into a propagation matrix for graph neural networks. Finally, a Time-extrapolator Convolutional Neural Network (TXP-CNN) is used in the temporal dimension of the aggregated features to predict the future trajectories of the pedestrians. Experimental results on benchmark pedestrian datasets (ETH and UCY) reveal the competitive performances of AST-GNN in terms of both the final displace error (FDE) and average displacement error (ADE) as compared with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Trajectory-user link with attention recurrent networks,"The prevalent adoptions of GPS-enabled devices have witnessed an explosion of various location-based services which produces a huge amount of trajectories monitoring the individuals' movements. In this paper, we tackle Trajectory-User Link (TUL) problem, which identifies humans' movement patterns and links trajectories to the users who generated them. Existing solutions on TUL problem employ recurrent neural networks and variational autoencoder methods, which face the bottlenecks in the case of excessively long trajectories and fragmentary users' movements. However, these are common characteristics of trajectory data in reality, leading to performance degradation of the existing models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end attention recurrent neural learning framework, called TULAR (Trajectory-User Link with Attention Recurrent Networks), which focus on selected parts of the source trajectories when linking. TULAR introduce the Trajectory Semantic Vector (TSV) via unsupervised location representation learning and recurrent neural networks, by which to reckon the weight of parts of source trajectory. Further, we employ three attention scores for the weight measurements. Experiments are conducted on two real world datasets and compared with several existing methods, and the results show that TULAR yields a new state-of-the-art performance.
