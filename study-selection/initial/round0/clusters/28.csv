Title,Abstract
Pan-genome de Bruijn graph using the bidirectional FM-index,"Background: Pan-genome graphs are gaining importance in the field of bioinformatics as data structures to represent and jointly analyze multiple genomes. Compacted de Bruijn graphs are inherently suited for this purpose, as their graph topology naturally reveals similarity and divergence within the pan-genome. Most state-of-the-art pan-genome graphs are represented explicitly in terms of nodes and edges. Recently, an alternative, implicit graph representation was proposed that builds directly upon the unidirectional FM-index. As such, a memory-efficient graph data structure is obtained that inherits the FM-index’ backward search functionality. However, this representation suffers from a number of shortcomings in terms of functionality and algorithmic performance. Results: We present a data structure for a pan-genome, compacted de Bruijn graph that aims to address these shortcomings. It is built on the bidirectional FM-index, extending the ability of its unidirectional counterpart to navigate and search the graph in both directions. All basic graph navigation steps can be performed in constant time. Based on these features, we implement subgraph visualization as well as lossless approximate pattern matching to the graph using search schemes. We demonstrate that we can retrieve all occurrences corresponding to a read within a certain edit distance in a very efficient manner. Through a case study, we show the potential of exploiting the information embedded in the graph’s topology through visualization and sequence alignment. Conclusions: We propose a memory-efficient representation of the pan-genome graph that supports subgraph visualization and lossless approximate pattern matching of reads against the graph using search schemes.

Heterogeneous graph knowledge distillation neural network incorporating multiple relations and cross-semantic interactions,"In recent years, the study of real-world graphs has revealed their inherent heterogeneity, prompting growing research interest in heterogeneous graphs. Characterized by diverse node and relation types, heterogeneous graphs have led to the development of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which possess the remarkable ability of modeling such heterogeneity. Consequently, researchers have embraced these networks, applying them in various domains. A prevalent approach is using meta-path based methods in heterogeneous graph neural networks. However, a significant limitation arises from the fact that such methods tend to overlook vital attribute information within intermediate nodes and disregard relevant semantics across various meta-paths. To address the above limitations, we propose a new model named HGNN-MRCS. Specifically, HGNN-MRCS incorporates three key components, i.e., a relation aware module to encapsulate the attribute information of the intermediate nodes; a meta-path aware technique to facilitate learning of semantic information of each meta-path and enable higher-order representation learning; and a knowledge distillation strategy to learn relevant semantics across meta-paths and fuse them. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this work over the SOAT methods.

OSGNN: Original graph and Subgraph aggregated Graph Neural Network,"Heterogeneous Graph Embedding (HGE) is receiving a great attention from researchers, as it can be widely and effectively used to solve problems from various real-world applications. The existing HGE models mainly learn node representation directly on the whole heterogeneous graph by aggregating neighboring information, which unavoidably leads to the loss of useful high-order information. Another mainstream is to split heterogeneous graphs into different homogeneous subgraphs and then learn representations separately. However, this isolated handling way is prone to the loss of important interactions between the nodes of the same type. To address the above challenging but interesting problems, we propose an Original graph and Subgraph aggregated Graph Neural Network (OSGNN). Specifically, we first split the original heterogeneous graph into several subgraphs, and then weighted combine them to get a new meaningful homogeneous graph. Finally, the first-order and high-order information of the target node are learned from the original heterogeneous graph and the homogeneous subgraph respectively and concatenated as the final node representation. Extensive experiments on three real-world heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

"A Survey on Heterogeneous Graph Embedding: Methods, Techniques, Applications and Sources","Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) also known as heterogeneous information networks have become ubiquitous in real-world scenarios; therefore, HG embedding, which aims to learn representations in a lower-dimension space while preserving the heterogeneous structures and semantics for downstream tasks (e.g., node/graph classification, node clustering, link prediction), has drawn considerable attentions in recent years. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive review of the recent development on HG embedding methods and techniques. We first introduce the basic concepts of HG and discuss the unique challenges brought by the heterogeneity for HG embedding in comparison with homogeneous graph representation learning; and then we systemically survey and categorize the state-of-the-art HG embedding methods based on the information they used in the learning process to address the challenges posed by the HG heterogeneity. In particular, for each representative HG embedding method, we provide detailed introduction and further analyze its pros and cons; meanwhile, we also explore the transformativeness and applicability of different types of HG embedding methods in the real-world industrial environments for the first time. In addition, we further present several widely deployed systems that have demonstrated the success of HG embedding techniques in resolving real-world application problems with broader impacts. To facilitate future research and applications in this area, we also summarize the open-source code, existing graph learning platforms and benchmark datasets. Finally, we explore the additional issues and challenges of HG embedding and forecast the future research directions in this field.  © 2015 IEEE."
Seq-HGNN: Learning Sequential Node Representation on Heterogeneous Graph,"Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) in information retrieval (IR) applications. Many existing HGNNs design a variety of tailor-made graph convolutions to capture structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. However, existing HGNNs usually represent each node as a single vector in the multi-layer graph convolution calculation, which makes the high-level graph convolution layer fail to distinguish information from different relations and different orders, resulting in the information loss in the message passing. To this end, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network with sequential node representation, namely Seq-HGNN. To avoid the information loss caused by the single vector node representation, we first design a sequential node representation learning mechanism to represent each node as a sequence of meta-path representations during the node message passing. Then we propose a heterogeneous representation fusion module, empowering Seq-HGNN to identify important meta-paths and aggregate their representations into a compact one. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets from Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB) and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Beyond Homophily: Reconstructing Structure for Graph-agnostic Clustering,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved impressive performance on node clustering task. However, they are designed on the homophilic assumption of graph and clustering on heterophilic graph is overlooked. Due to the lack of labels, it is impossible to first identify a graph as homophilic or heterophilic before a suitable GNN model can be found. Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network. To be graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high homophily and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the adverse coupling between node attribute and topological structure, we separately map them into two subspaces in dual graph clustering network. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising performance. In particular, our method dominates others on heterophilic graphs.

Multi-modal Structure-embedding Graph Transformer for Visual Commonsense Reasoning,"Visual commonsense reasoning&#x00A0;(VCR) is a challenging reasoning task that aims to not only answer the question based on a given image but also provide a rationale justifying for the choice. Graph-based networks are appropriate to represent and extract the correlation between image and language for reasoning, where how to construct and learn graphs based on such multi-modal Euclidean data is a fundamental problem. Most existing graph-based methods view visual regions and linguistic words as identical graph nodes, ignoring inherent characteristics of multi-modal data. In addition, these approaches typically only have one graph-learning layer, and the performance declines as the model goes deeper. To address these issues, a novel method named Multi-modal Structure-embedding Graph Transformer&#x00A0;(MSGT) is proposed. Specifically, an answer-vision graph and an answer-question graph are constructed to represent and model intra-modal and inter-modal correlations in VCR simultaneously, where additional multi-modal structure representations are initialized and embedded according to visual region distances and linguistic word orders for more reasonable graph representation. Then, a structure-injecting graph transformer is designed to inject embedded structure priors into the semantic correlation matrix for the evolution of node features and structure representations, which can stack more layers to make model deeper and extract more powerful features with instructive priors. To adaptively fuse graph features, a scored pooling mechanism is further developed to select valuable clues for reasoning from learnt node features. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MSGT framework compared with state-of-the-art methods on the VCR benchmark dataset.

Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network,"Heterogeneous graph convolutional networks have gained great popularity in tackling various network analytical tasks on heterogeneous network data, ranging from link prediction to node classification. However, most existing works ignore the relation heterogeneity with multiplex network between multi-typed nodes and different importance of relations in meta-paths for node embedding, which can hardly capture the heterogeneous structure signals across different relations. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN) for heterogeneous network embedding. Our MHGCN can automatically learn the useful heterogeneous meta-path interactions of different lengths in multiplex heterogeneous networks through multi-layer convolution aggregation. Additionally, we effectively integrate both multi-relation structural signals and attribute semantics into the learned node embeddings with both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets with various network analytical tasks demonstrate the significant superiority of MHGCN against state-of-the-art embedding baselines in terms of all evaluation metrics.

LGGNet: Learning From Local-Global-Graph Representations for Brain&#x2013;Computer Interface,"Neuropsychological studies suggest that co-operative activities among different brain functional areas drive high-level cognitive processes. To learn the brain activities within and among different functional areas of the brain, we propose local-global-graph network (LGGNet), a novel neurologically inspired graph neural network (GNN), to learn local-global-graph (LGG) representations of electroencephalography (EEG) for brain&#x2013;computer interface (BCI). The input layer of LGGNet comprises a series of temporal convolutions with multiscale 1-D convolutional kernels and kernel-level attentive fusion. It captures temporal dynamics of EEG which then serves as input to the proposed local-and global-graph-filtering layers. Using a defined neurophysiologically meaningful set of local and global graphs, LGGNet models the complex relations within and among functional areas of the brain. Under the robust nested cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on three publicly available datasets for four types of cognitive classification tasks, namely the attention, fatigue, emotion, and preference classification tasks. LGGNet is compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, such as DeepConvNet, EEGNet, R2G-STNN, TSception, regularized graph neural network (RGNN), attention-based multiscale convolutional neural network-dynamical graph convolutional network (AMCNN-DGCN), hierarchical recurrent neural network (HRNN), and GraphNet. The results show that LGGNet outperforms these methods, and the improvements are statistically significant (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$p&lt;0.05$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) in most cases. The results show that bringing neuroscience prior knowledge into neural network design yields an improvement of classification performance.

MAHE-IM: Multiple Aggregation of Heterogeneous Relation Embedding for Influence Maximization on Heterogeneous Information Network,"Influence maximization (IM), as an essential problem in social network analysis, can identify a minimum group of the influential nodes to maximize the spread of information on the network. The majority of IM studies focus on homogeneous networks, whereas in real world, heterogeneous networks are ubiquitous. The existing IM methods based on homogeneous networks do not consider a variety of complex heterogeneous relationships and the attribute of different types of nodes, which don't accommodate most real scenario. It is of great significance to study IM methods based on heterogeneous networks, where efficient integrating complex multiple semantic relationships and structures embedded in the heterogeneous network is the key breakthrough point. In this paper, a novel deep learning algorithm for influence maximization on heterogeneous networks based on a multiple aggregation of heterogeneous relation embedding named MAHE-IM is proposed, which can capture the heterogeneous high-order structure and semantic features of heterogeneous information networks. For more comprehensive and systematical evaluation of MAHE-IM, we further extend fourteen state-of-the-art homogeneous and heterogeneous network embedding and graph neural network methods for IM problem and propose fourteen extented IM algorithms. Four popular IM algorithms and our extended fourteen IM algorithms are taken as eighteen baseline algorithms, which can be categorized three types: greedy-based, network embedding-based and GNN-based IM algorithms. Compared with eighteen baseline algorithms, the experimental results illustrate that MAHE-IM is significantly efficient and effective. MAHE-IM is more practical on heterogeneous networks. In addition, in order to maximize the convenience for users, a webserver (https://mahe-im.com/) is developed. The users can obtain the IM results by submitting their heterogeneous networks to the webserver.

HybridNet: Integrating GCN and CNN for skeleton-based action recognition,"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can well-preserve the structure information of the human body. They have achieved outstanding performance in skeleton-based action recognition. Nevertheless, there are still some issues with existing GCN-based methods. First, all channels have the same adjacency matrix. However, the correlations between joints are complex and may drastically change depending on the actions. These correlations are difficult to fit by merely channel-shared adjacency matrices. Second, the interframe edges of graphs only connect the same joints, neglecting the dependencies between the different joints. Fortunately, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can simultaneously establish the interdependence of all the points in a spatial-temporal patch. Furthermore, CNNs use different kernels among channels. They are more adaptable for modeling complicated dependencies. In this work, we design a hybrid network (HybridNet) to integrate GCNs and CNNs. The HybridNet not only utilizes structural information well but also models complicated relationships between interframe joints properly.Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets: NTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D 120, and Skeleton-Kinetics. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets by a considerable margin, demonstrating the superiority of our method.

K-Core Based Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Dynamic Graphs,"Graph representation learning is a fundamental task in various applications that strives to learn low-dimensional embeddings for nodes that can preserve graph topology information. However, many existing methods focus on static graphs while ignoring evolving graph patterns. Inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks(GCNs) in static graph embedding, we propose a novel k-core based temporal graph convolutional network, the CTGCN, to learn node representations for dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous dynamic graph embedding methods, CTGCN can preserve both local connective proximity and global structural similarity while simultaneously capturing graph dynamics. In the proposed framework, the traditional graph convolution is generalized into two phases, feature transformation and feature aggregation, which gives the CTGCN more flexibility and enables the CTGCN to learn connective and structural information under the same framework. Experimental results on 7 real-world graphs demonstrate that the CTGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in several tasks, including link prediction and structural role classification.

SAGN: Semantic adaptive graph network for skeleton-based human action recognition,"With the continuous development and popularity of depth cameras, skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted people's wide attention. Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has achieved remarkable performance. However, the existing methods do not better consider the semantic characteristics, which can help to express the current concept and scene information. Semantic information can also help with better granularity classification. In addition, most of the existing models require a lot of computation. What's more, adaptive GCN can automatically learn the graph structure and consider the connections between joints. In this paper, we propose a relatively less computationally intensive model, which combines semantic and adaptive graph network (SAGN) for skeleton-based human action recognition. Specifically, we mainly combine the dynamic characteristics and bone information to extract the data, taking the correlation between semantics into the model. In the training process, SAGN includes an adaptive network so that we can make attention mechanism more flexible. We design the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction on the time dimension. The experimental results show that SAGN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on NTU-RGB+D 60 and NTU-RGB+D 120 datasets. SAGN can promote the study of skeleton-based human action recognition.

Heterogeneous Hypergraph Embedding for Graph Classification,"Recently, graph neural networks have been widely used for network embedding because of their prominent performance in pairwise relationship learning. In the real world, a more natural and common situation is the coexistence of pairwise relationships and complex non-pairwise relationships, which is, however, rarely studied. In light of this, we propose a graph neural network-based representation learning framework for heterogeneous hypergraphs, an extension of conventional graphs, which can well characterize multiple non-pairwise relations. Our framework first projects the heterogeneous hypergraph into a series of snapshots and then we take the Wavelet basis to perform localized hypergraph convolution. Since the Wavelet basis is usually much sparser than the Fourier basis, we develop an efficient polynomial approximation to the basis to replace the time-consuming Laplacian decomposition. Extensive evaluations have been conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our method. In addition to the standard tasks of network embedding evaluation such as node classification, we also apply our method to the task of spammers detection and the superior performance of our framework shows that relationships beyond pairwise are also advantageous in the spammer detection. To make our experiment repeatable, source codes and related datasets are available at https://xiangguosun.mystrikingly.com  © 2021 ACM."
Dimensionwise Separable 2-D Graph Convolution for Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs,"Graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) have been the model of choice for graph representation learning, which is mainly due to the effective design of graph convolution that computes the representation of a node by aggregating those of its neighbors. However, existing GCN variants commonly use 1-D graph convolution that solely operates on the object link graph without exploring informative relational information among object attributes. This significantly limits their modeling capability and may lead to inferior performance on noisy and sparse real-world networks. In this paper, we explore 2-D graph convolution to jointly model object links and attribute relations for graph representation learning. Specifically, we propose a computationally efficient dimensionwise separable 2-D graph convolution (DSGC) for filtering node features. Theoretically, we show that DSGC can reduce intra-class variance of node features on both the object dimension and the attribute dimension to learn more effective representations. Empirically, we demonstrate that by modeling attribute relations, DSGC achieves significant performance gain over state-of-the-art methods for node classification and clustering on a variety of real-world networks.

ON GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS VERSUS GRAPH-AUGMENTED MLPS,"From the perspectives of expressive power and learning, this work compares multi-layer Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a simplified alternative that we call Graph-Augmented Multi-Layer Perceptrons (GA-MLPs), which first augments node features with certain multi-hop operators on the graph and then applies learnable node-wise functions. From the perspective of graph isomorphism testing, we show both theoretically and numerically that GA-MLPs with suitable operators can distinguish almost all non-isomorphic graphs, just like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and GNNs. However, by viewing them as node-level functions and examining the equivalence classes they induce on rooted graphs, we prove a separation in expressive power between GA-MLPs and GNNs that grows exponentially in depth. In particular, unlike GNNs, GA-MLPs are unable to count the number of attributed walks. We also demonstrate via community detection experiments that GA-MLPs can be limited by their choice of operator family, whereas GNNs have higher flexibility in learning. © 2021 ICLR 2021 - 9th International Conference on Learning Representations.

Heterogeneous Graph Transformer,"Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of graph neural networks (GNNs) for modeling structured data. However, most GNNs are designed for homogeneous graphs, in which all nodes and edges belong to the same types, making it infeasible to represent heterogeneous structures. In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm - HGSampling - for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9-21 on various downstream tasks. The dataset and source code of HGT are publicly available at https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT. © 2020 ACM."
Hypergraph Attention Isomorphism Network by Learning Line Graph Expansion,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance for node representation and classification in a network. But, most of the existing GNNs can be applied to simple graphs, where an edge connects only a pair of nodes. Studies have shown that hypergraphs are effective to model real-world relationships which are of higher order in nature. Recently, graph neural networks are proposed for hypergraphs, but they implicitly use clique or star expansions to convert the hypergraph to a simple graph, or use computationally expensive hypergraph Laplacian.In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph neural network for semi-supervised hypernode classification, which operates directly on the hypergraphs with varying hyperedge sizes. Within each layer, it indirectly works on the line graph of the given hypergraph, without actually forming the line graph explicitly. Moreover, it also employs a self-attention mechanism to learn the weights of those edge relationships. Experimentally, HAIN is able to improve the state-of-the-art hypernode classification performance on all the datasets we use. We make the source code available to ease the reproducibility of the results. © 2020 IEEE."
Revisiting graph based collaborative filtering: A linear residual graph convolutional network approach,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are state-of-the-art graph based representation learning models by iteratively stacking multiple layers of convolution aggregation operations and non-linear activation operations. Recently, in Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems (RS), by treating the user-item interaction behavior as a bipartite graph, some researchers model higher-layer collaborative signals with GCNs. These GCN based recommender models show superior performance compared to traditional works. However, these models suffer from training difficulty with non-linear activations for large user-item graphs. Besides, most GCN based models could not model deeper layers due to the over smoothing effect with the graph convolution operation. In this paper, we revisit GCN based CF models from two aspects. First, we empirically show that removing non-linearities would enhance recommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple graph convolutional networks. Second, we propose a residual network structure that is specifically designed for CF with user-item interaction modeling, which alleviates the over smoothing problem in graph convolution aggregation operation with sparse user-item interaction data. The proposed model is a linear model and it is easy to train, scale to large datasets, and yield better efficiency and effectiveness on two real datasets.

COMPOSITION-BASED MULTI-RELATIONAL GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS,"Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to be quite successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, the primary focus has been on handling simple undirected graphs. Multi-relational graphs are a more general and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction associated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose COMPGCN, a novel Graph Convolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a relational graph. COMPGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition operations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number of relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN methods. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, and achieve demonstrably superior results. We make the source code of COMPGCN available to foster reproducible research. © 2020 8th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2020. All rights reserved."
