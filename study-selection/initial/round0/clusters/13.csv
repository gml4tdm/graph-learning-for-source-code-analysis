A Hierarchical Graph V-Net with Semi-Supervised Pre-Training for Histological Image Based Breast Cancer Classification,"Numerous patch-based methods have recently been proposed for histological image based breast cancer classification. However, their performance could be highly affected by ignoring spatial contextual information in the whole slide image (WSI). To address this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical Graph V-Net by integrating 1) patch-level pre-training and 2) context-based fine-tuning, with a hierarchical graph network. Specifically, a semi-supervised framework based on knowledge distillation is first developed to pre-train a patch encoder for extracting disease-relevant features. Then, a hierarchical Graph V-Net is designed to construct a hierarchical graph representation from neighboring/similar individual patches for coarse-to-fine classification, where each graph node (corresponding to one patch) is attached with extracted disease-relevant features and its target label during training is the average label of all pixels in the corresponding patch. To evaluate the performance of our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net, we collect a large WSI dataset of 560 WSIs, with 30 labeled WSIs from the BACH dataset (through our further refinement), 30 labeled WSIs and 500 unlabeled WSIs from Yunnan Cancer Hospital. Those 500 unlabeled WSIs are employed for patch-level pre-training to improve feature representation, while 60 labeled WSIs are used to train and test our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net. Both comparative assessment and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our proposed hierarchical Graph V-Net over state-of-the-art methods in classifying breast cancer from WSIs.

A One-Size-Fits-Three Representation Learning Framework for Patient Similarity Search,"Patient similarity search is an essential task in healthcare. Recent studies adopted electronic health records (EHRs) to learn patient representations for measuring the clinical similarities. These methods outperformed traditional methods, by capturing more information from various sources consisting of multi-modal EHRs, external knowledge and correlations among medical concepts. They often concerned certain type of data without taking full advantage of various information. We propose a graph representation learning framework, denoted by One-Size-Fits-Three (OSFT), that takes into account fusion-attention, neighbor-attention and global-attention from three types of information. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets of MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, and the results verified the effectiveness and generality of our framework. When compared with baselines on patient similarity search, our framework achieved good effectiveness and comparative efficiency. The results provide new insights about whether the use of various information can better measure the patient similarity.

Cooperative dual medical ontology representation learning for clinical assisted decision-making,"Objective: Predicting clinical events and providing assisted decision-making using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) play a central role in personalized healthcare. Despite the promising performance achieved for diagnosis and procedure predictions, most of the existing predictive models regard different medical codes as the same type and generally ignore the dependence between diagnoses and procedures in patients’ admission history. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end cooperative dual medical ontology representation learning framework for clinical assisted decision-making. Materials and Methods: The framework consists of two primary modules: (1) dual medical ontology representation learning to facilitate the learning of medical concepts and (2) task dependent multi-task prediction to capture the correlation between diagnoses and procedures in patients’ admission history. We evaluate our method with EHRs from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database, covering 6321 patients and 16335 visits. Results: Experiments conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset show that the proposed model achieves the best performance, with a top-20 accuracy of 58.20% for diagnosis prediction and a top-20 accuracy of 75.85% for procedure prediction. In addition, a series of experimental analyses and case studies further illustrate the excellent performance of our model. Conclusion: We propose an end-to-end cooperative dual medical ontology representation learning framework, which achieves superior performance on multi-task diagnosis and procedure predictions.

Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Multi-Modal Medical Data Analysis,"Routine clinical visits of a patient produce not only image data, but also non-image data containing clinical information regarding the patient, i.e., medical data is multimodal in nature. Such heterogeneous modalities offer different and complementary perspectives on the same patient, resulting in more accurate clinical decisions when they are properly combined. However, despite its significance, how to effectively fuse the multi-modal medical data into a unified framework has received relatively little attention. In this paper, we propose an effective graph-based framework called HetMed (Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Multi-modal Medical Data Analysis) for fusing the multi-modal medical data. Specifically, we construct a multiplex network that incorporates multiple types of non-image features of patients to capture the complex relationship between patients in a systematic way, which leads to more accurate clinical decisions. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and practicality of HetMed.

Self-Supervised Graph Learning with Hyperbolic Embedding for Temporal Health Event Prediction,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have been heavily used in modern healthcare systems for recording patients' admission information to health facilities. Many data-driven approaches employ temporal features in EHR for predicting specific diseases, readmission times, and diagnoses of patients. However, most existing predictive models cannot fully utilize EHR data, due to an inherent lack of labels in supervised training for some temporal events. Moreover, it is hard for the existing methods to simultaneously provide generic and personalized interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Sherbet, a self-supervised graph learning framework with hyperbolic embeddings for temporal health event prediction. We first propose a hyperbolic embedding method with information flow to pretrain medical code representations in a hierarchical structure. We incorporate these pretrained representations into a graph neural network (GNN) to detect disease complications and design a multilevel attention method to compute the contributions of particular diseases and admissions, thus enhancing personalized interpretability. We present a new hierarchy-enhanced historical prediction proxy task in our self-supervised learning framework to fully utilize EHR data and exploit medical domain knowledge. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on widely used publicly available EHR datasets to verify the effectiveness of our model. Our results demonstrate the proposed model's strengths in both predictive tasks and interpretable abilities.  © 2013 IEEE."
TCMCoRep: Traditional Chinese Medicine Data Mining with Contrastive Graph Representation Learning,"Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM) is a highly empirical, subjective and practical discipline. One of the most realistic data mining tasks in TCM is prescription generation. While recommendation models could be applied to provide herb recommendation, they are limited to modeling only the interactions between herbs and symptoms, ignoring the intermediate process of syndrome induction, which betrays a main principle in real-world TCM diagnosis: doctors suggest herb based on the holism syndrome inducted from symptoms. Targeting on this pain point, we proposed TCMCoRep, a novel graph contrastive representation learning framework with explicit syndrome awareness. For a given symptom set, predictive representation from TCMCoRep not only locates high quality prescription herbs but also explicitly detects corresponding syndrome via syndrome-aware prescription generation that follows the philosophy of TCM diagnosis in real life. Hybridization of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph convolutions is able to preserve graph heterogeneity preventing the possible damage from early augmentation, to convey strong samples for contrastive learning. Experiments conducted in practical datasets demonstrate our proposed model’s competitive performance compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, revealing the great potential in real-world applications.

Inductive Representation Learning of Multiple ICD Codes for Healthcare,"The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding scheme authorized by the World Health Organization, is a standard used to classify medical diagnosis in health insurance claims. One of the key challenges in adopting machine learning techniques for health insurance claims processing lies in the sparse and complex nature of ICD codes. There are over 69,000 unique diagnosis codes in the 10th version of the ICD coding scheme where multiple codes are used to represent complex medical diagnosis. In this work, we address the challenge of embedding both single and multiple ICD codes into a vector space. This representation addresses the sparse representation of ICD codes by providing a more compact representation that captures their diagnosis relationship. Our proposed inductive multi-code representation introduces a novel application of inductive node embedding by representing multiple ICD codes as a multi-code node. This enables both single and multiple ICD codes to be represented in the same vector space. For multi-code relevance, our proposed approached surpassed the benchmark node2vec implementation by 34%, highlighting its effectiveness.  © 2022 IEEE."
Multi-layer Representation Learning and Its Application to Electronic Health Records,"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records associated with hospitalization, diagnosis, medications and so on. Secondary use of EHRs can promote the clinical informatics applications and the development of healthcare undertaking. EHRs have the unique characteristic where the patient visits are temporally ordered but the diagnosis codes within a visit are randomly ordered. The hierarchical structure requires a multi-layer network to explore the different relational information of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Representation Learning method (MLRL), which is capable of learning effective patient representation by hierarchically exploring the valuable information in both diagnosis codes and patient visits. Firstly, MLRL utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to explore the potential connections in diagnosis codes, and a linear transformation is implemented to further map the code vectors to non-negative real-valued representations. The initial visit vectors are then obtained by summarizing all the code representations. Secondly, the proposed method combines Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with self-attention mechanism to learn the weighted visit vectors which are aggregated to form the patient representation. Finally, to evaluate the performance of MLRL, we apply it to patient’s mortality prediction on real EHRs and the experimental results demonstrate that MLRL has a significant improvement in prediction performance. MLRL achieves around 0.915 in Area Under Curve which is superior to the results obtained by baseline methods. Furthermore, compared with raw data and other data representations, the learned representation with MLRL shows its outstanding results and availability on multiple different classifiers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature."
Medical concept representation learning from multi-source data,"Representing words as low dimensional vectors is very useful in many natural language processing tasks. This idea has been extended to medical domain where medical codes listed in medical claims are represented as vectors to facilitate exploratory analysis and predictive modeling. However, depending on a type of a medical provider, medical claims can use medical codes from different ontologies or from a combination of ontologies, which complicates learning of the representations. To be able to properly utilize such multi-source medical claim data, we propose an approach that represents medical codes from different ontologies in the same vector space. We first modify the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measure of similarity between the codes. We then develop a new negative sampling method for word2vec model that implicitly factorizes the modified PMI matrix. The new approach was evaluated on the code cross-reference problem, which aims at identifying similar codes across different ontologies. In our experiments, we evaluated cross-referencing between ICD-9 and CPT medical code ontologies. Our results indicate that vector representations of codes learned by the proposed approach provide superior cross-referencing when compared to several existing approaches. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Deep Learning for Analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR),"In current scenario, every medical equipment, clinical instrument, lab setup in healthcare centres and hospitals, is linked with digital devices which has brought about digital data explosion. Due to this, the amount of digital information generated and stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has increased exponentially. Therefore, EHRs have become an area of booming research, as EHRs can provide a host of untouched possibilities which, the data contained in them, can bring about. EHRs have several classification schema and controlled vocabularies are present to record relevant medical information and events. Thus, harmonizing and analysing data among institutions and across terminologies is an ongoing field of research. Several clinical code representation forms have been proposed by various deep learning EHR systems that share themselves easily to cross institutional analysis and applications. EHR records have primary use in storing patient information such as patient medical history, progress, demography, diagnosis and medications. But researchers across the globe have invented secondary use of EHRs for several clinical and health informatics applications. Secondary usage of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to boost clinical research and result into better informed clinical decision making. Challenge in summarizing and representing patient data prevents widespread practice to predict the future of patients using EHRs. Simultaneously, over the span of time, the machine learning field has witnessed widespread advancements in the area of deep learning. The current research in healthcare informatics focusses on applying deep learning based on EHRs to clinical tasks. In this context, the deep learning techniques described here can be applied to various types of clinical applications such as extraction of information, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping and de-identification. Several limitations of current research have been identified like model interpretability and heterogeneity of data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Pre-training of graph augmented transformers for medication recommendation,"Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process. To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the medication recommendation task. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.
