Title,Abstract
Semantic and Structural View Fusion Modeling for Social Recommendation,"Existing studies have shown that user-item interaction data and social relation data can be jointly used for enhancing the performance of social recommendation. However, limited research has a focus on investigating how to deeply exploit different views of social interaction structures and rating behavior differences for further improving social recommendation. To this end, in this paper, we propose to integrate information from both semantic and structural views for social recommendation. Specifically, we first design a collective intelligence-based strategy to reveal high-quality implicit relations for both users and items. Then, by reformulating all available nodes and relations as a heterogeneous graph, we define multiple semantic metapaths to capture diverse preferences for comprehensive user and item representations. While various metapaths enlarge the representation capacity of users and items, they also introduce noise and irrelevant information. We recall that, for the user-item interaction graph, different structure sizes (e.g., local and global structures) provide diverse and complementary information for recommendation. Motivated by this, we propose a semantic and structural view fusion framework for social recommendation (S4Rec), which consists of a deep graph model and a wide attentive SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) model for rating prediction by taking the local and global structure as input and aggregating messages along the predefined metapaths. Finally, the two predicted results are adaptively fused to achieve the final both accurate and stable prediction. In addition, we treat the user's rating behavior difference as the relative position difference problem in the embedding space, and model it with TransH to improve the generalization ability of the main rating model. Extensive experiments on three open datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared with state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, our model outperforms other baselines under different sparsity conditions, further validating the effectiveness on cold-start users.

BA-GNN: Behavior-aware graph neural network for session-based recommendation,"Session-based recommendation is a popular research topic that aims to predict users’ next possible interactive item by exploiting anonymous sessions. The existing studies mainly focus on making predictions by considering users’ single interactive behavior. Some recent efforts have been made to exploit multiple interactive behaviors, but they generally ignore the influences of different interactive behaviors and the noise in interactive sequences. To address these problems, we propose a behavior-aware graph neural network for session-based recommendation. First, different interactive sequences are modeled as directed graphs. Thus, the item representations are learned via graph neural networks. Then, a sparse self-attention module is designed to remove the noise in behavior sequences. Finally, the representations of different behavior sequences are aggregated with the gating mechanism to obtain the session representations. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our proposed method outperforms all competitive baselines.

Neural-Symbolic Recommendation with Graph-Enhanced Information,"The recommendation task is not only a problem of inductive statistics from data but also a cognitive task that requires reasoning ability. The most advanced graph neural networks have been widely used in recommendation systems because they can capture implicit structured information from graph-structured data. However, like most neural network algorithms, they only learn matching patterns from a perception perspective. Some researchers use user behavior for logic reasoning to achieve recommendation prediction from the perspective of cognitive reasoning, but this kind of reasoning is a local one and ignores implicit information on a global scale. In this work, we combine the advantages of graph neural networks and propositional logic operations to construct a neuro-symbolic recommendation model with both global implicit reasoning ability and local explicit logic reasoning ability. We first build an item-item graph based on the principle of adjacent interaction and use graph neural networks to capture implicit information in global data. Then we transform user behavior into propositional logic expressions to achieve recommendations from the perspective of cognitive reasoning. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show that our proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, source code is avaliable at [ https://github.com/hanzo2020/GNNLR ]. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
Community aware graph embedding learning for item recommendation,"Due to the heterogeneity of a large amount of real-world data, meta-paths are widely used in recommendation. Such recommendation methods can represent composite relationships between entities, but cannot explore reliable relations between nodes and influence among meta-paths. For solving this problem, a Community Aware Graph Embedding Learning method for Item Recommendation(CAEIRec) is proposed. By adaptively constructing communities for nodes in the graph of entities, the correlations of nodes are embedded in graph learning from the aspect of community structure. Semantic information of users and items are jointly learnt in the embedding. Finally, the embeddings of users and items are fed to extend matrix factorization for getting the top recommendations. A series of comprehensive experiments are conducted on two different public datasets. The empirical results show that CAEIRec is an encouraging recommendation method by the comarison with the state-of-the-art methods.

Graph Transformer for Recommendation,"This paper presents a novel approach to representation learning in recommender systems by integrating generative self-supervised learning with graph transformer architecture. We highlight the importance of high-quality data augmentation with relevant self-supervised pretext tasks for improving performance. Towards this end, we propose a new approach that automates the self-supervision augmentation process through a rationale-aware generative SSL that distills informative user-item interaction patterns. The proposed recommender with Graph TransFormer (GFormer) that offers parameterized collaborative rationale discovery for selective augmentation while preserving global-aware user-item relationships. In GFormer, we allow the rationale-aware SSL to inspire graph collaborative filtering with task-adaptive invariant rationalization in graph transformer. The experimental results reveal that our GFormer has the capability to consistently improve the performance over baselines on different datasets. Several in-depth experiments further investigate the invariant rationale-aware augmentation from various aspects.

EEDN: Enhanced Encoder-Decoder Network with Local and Global Context Learning for POI Recommendation,"The point-of-interest (POI) recommendation predicts users' destinations, which might be of interest to users and has attracted considerable attention as one of the major applications in location-based social networks (LBSNs). Recent work on graph-based neural networks (GNN) or matrix factorization-based (MF) approaches has resulted in better representations of users and POIs to forecast users' latent preferences. However, they still suffer from the implicit feedback and cold-start problems of check-in data, as they cannot capture both local and global graph-based relations among users (or POIs) simultaneously, and the cold-start neighbors are not handled properly during graph convolution in GNN. In this paper, we propose an enhanced encoder-decoder network (EEDN) to exploit rich latent features between users, POIs, and interactions between users and POIs for POI recommendation. The encoder of EEDN utilizes a hybrid hypergraph convolution to enhance the aggregation ability of each graph convolution step and learns to derive more robust cold-start-aware user representations. In contrast, the decoder mines local and global interactions by both graph- and sequential-based patterns for modeling implicit feedback, especially to alleviate exposure bias. Extensive experiments in three public real-world datasets demonstrate that EEDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

DAS-GNN: Denoising autoencoder integrated with self-supervised learning in graph neural network-based recommendations,"To enhance the recommendation performance, session-based recommendations typically model based on graph neural networks (GNN). These models use the most recently clicked item as the user’s short-term interest, as well as the query vector in the attention mechanism. Based on it, the attention score is calculated with the remaining items to obtain the user’s long-term interest. However, the obtained representation of long-term interest is one-sided. Furthermore, unlike other recommendation technology, such as collaborative filtering that includes the user’s entire history information, the session-based recommendation is more vulnerable to data sparsity. Existing models primarily make predictions based on observable user-item interactions and ignore items not interacted with by users. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose the denoising autoencoder integrated with self-supervised learning (SSL) in graph neural networks (DAS-GNN). In DAS-GNN, the query extraction module based on denoising autoencoder can mine multiple user interests and assist long-term interest to express user needs more comprehensively. We propose an effective way of dividing positive and negative samples in the SSL module and use adaptive thresholds to mine negative hard samples, thereby improving training efficiency and alleviating data sparsity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DAS-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art models on four benchmarks.

Robust Preference-Guided Denoising for Graph based Social Recommendation,"Graph Neural Network (GNN) based social recommendation models improve the prediction accuracy of user preference by leveraging GNN in exploiting preference similarity contained in social relations. However, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent capability of improving three state-of-the-art social recommendation models by robustly removing 10-40% of original relations.

Code Recommendation for Open Source Software Developers,"Open Source Software (OSS) is forming the spines of technology infrastructures, attracting millions of talents to contribute. Notably, it is challenging and critical to consider both the developers' interests and the semantic features of the project code to recommend appropriate development tasks to OSS developers. In this paper, we formulate the novel problem of code recommendation, whose purpose is to predict the future contribution behaviors of developers given their interaction history, the semantic features of source code, and the hierarchical file structures of projects. We introduce CODER, a novel graph-based CODE Recommendation framework for open source software developers, which accounts for the complex interactions among multiple parties within the system. CODER jointly models microscopic user-code interactions and macroscopic user-project interactions via a heterogeneous graph and further bridges the two levels of information through aggregation on file-structure graphs that reflect the project hierarchy. Moreover, to overcome the lack of reliable benchmarks, we construct three large-scale datasets to facilitate future research in this direction. Extensive experiments show that our CODER framework achieves superior performance under various experimental settings, including intra-project, cross-project, and cold-start recommendation. © 2023 Owner/Author."
Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools in modeling graph-structured data in recommender systems. However, real-life recommendation scenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user influence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information to enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of heterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation. In light of this, we propose a <u>H</u>eterogeneous <u>G</u>raph <u>C</u>ontrastive <u>L</u>earning (HGCL), which is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the user-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge transfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side information on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea forward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta networks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive contrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to benefit the recommendation performance improvement.

Search Behavior Prediction: A Hypergraph Perspective,"At E-Commerce stores such as Amazon, eBay, and Taobao, the shopping items and the query words that customers use to search for the items form a bipartite graph that captures search behavior. Such a query-item graph can be used to forecast search trends or improve search results. For example, generating query-item associations, which is equivalent to predicting links in the bipartite graph, can yield recommendations that can customize and improve the user search experience. Although the bipartite shopping graphs are straightforward to model search behavior, they suffer from two challenges: 1) The majority of items are sporadically searched and hence have noisy/sparse query associations, leading to a long-tail distribution. 2) Infrequent queries are more likely to link to popular items, leading to another hurdle known as disassortative mixing. To address these two challenges, we go beyond the bipartite graph to take a hypergraph perspective, introducing a new paradigm that leverages <u>auxiliary</u> information from anonymized customer engagement sessions to assist the <u>main task</u> of query-item link prediction. This auxiliary information is available at web scale in the form of search logs. We treat all items appearing in the same customer session as a single hyperedge. The hypothesis is that items in a customer session are unified by a common shopping interest. With these hyperedges, we augment the original bipartite graph into a new hypergraph. We develop a Dual-Channel Attention-Based Hypergraph Neural Network (DCAH), which synergizes information from two potentially noisy sources (original query-item edges and item-item hyperedges). In this way, items on the tail are better connected due to the extra hyperedges, thereby enhancing their link prediction performance. We further integrate DCAH with self-supervised graph pre-training and/or DropEdge training, both of which effectively alleviate disassortative mixing. Extensive experiments on three proprietary E-Commerce datasets show that DCAH yields significant improvements of up to 24.6% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and 48.3% in recall compared to GNN-based baselines.

GInRec: A Gated Architecture for Inductive Recommendation using Knowledge Graphs,"We have witnessed increasing interest in exploiting KGs to integrate contextual knowledge in recommender systems in addition to user-item interactions, e.g., ratings. Yet, most methods are transductive, i.e., they represent instances seen during training as low-dimensionality vectors but cannot do so for unseen instances. Hence, they require heavy retraining every time new items or users are added. Conversely, inductive methods promise to solve these issues. KGs enhance inductive recommendation by offering information on item-entity relationships, whereas existing inductive methods rely purely on interactions, which makes recommendations for users with few interactions sub-optimal and even impossible for new items. In this work, we investigate the actual ability of inductive methods exploiting both the structure and the data represented by KGs. Hence, we propose GInRec, a state-of-the-art method that uses a graph neural network with relation-specific gates and a KG to provide better recommendations for new users and items than related inductive methods. As a result, we re-evaluate state-of-the-art methods, identify better evaluation protocols, highlight unwarranted conclusions from previous proposals, and showcase a novel, stronger architecture for this task.

Disentangled Graph Social Recommendation,"Social recommender systems have drawn a lot of attention in many online web services, because of the incorporation of social information between users in improving recommendation results. Despite the significant progress made by existing solutions, we argue that current methods fall short in two limitations: (1) Existing social-aware recommendation models only consider collaborative similarity between items, how to incorporate item-wise semantic relatedness is less explored in current recommendation paradigms. (2) Current social recommender systems neglect the entanglement of the latent factors over heterogeneous relations (e.g., social connections, user-item interactions). Learning the disentangled representations with relation heterogeneity poses great challenge for social recommendation. In this work, we design a Disentangled Graph Neural Network (DGNN) with the integration of latent memory units, which empowers DGNN to maintain factorized representations for heterogeneous types of user and item connections. Additionally, we devise new memory-augmented message propagation and aggregation schemes under the graph neural architecture, allowing us to recursively distill semantic relatedness into the representations of users and items in a fully automatic manner. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our model by achieving great improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

Group Buying Recommendation Model Based on Multi-task Learning,"In recent years, group buying has become one popular kind of online shopping activities, thanks to its larger sales and lower unit price. Unfortunately, seldom research focuses on the recommendations specifically for group buying by now. Although some recommendation models have been proposed for group recommendation, they can not be directly used to achieve the real-world group buying recommendation, due to the essential difference between group recommendation and group buying recommendation. In this paper, we first formalize the task of group buying recommendation into two sub-tasks. Then, based on our insights into the correlations and interactions between the two sub-tasks, we propose a novel recommendation model for group buying, namely MGBR, which is built mainly with a multi-task learning module. To improve recommendation performance further, we devise some collaborative expert networks and adjusted gates in the multi-task learning module, to promote the information interaction between the two sub-tasks. Furthermore, we propose two auxiliary losses corresponding to the two sub-tasks, to refine the representation learning in our model. Our extensive experiments not only demonstrate that the augmented representations learned in our model result in better performance than previous recommendation models, but also justify the impacts of the specially designed components in our model. To reproduce our model's recommendation results conveniently, we have provided our model's source code and dataset on https://github.com/DeqingYang/MGBR.  © 2023 IEEE."
Planning Data Poisoning Attacks on Heterogeneous Recommender Systems in a Multiplayer Setting,"Data poisoning attacks against recommender systems (RecSys) often assume a single seller as the adversary. However, in reality, there are usually multiple sellers attempting to promote their items through RecSys manipulation. To obtain the best data poisoning plan, it is important for an attacker to anticipate and withstand the actions of his opponents. This work studies the problem of Multiplayer Comprehensive Attack (MCA) from the perspective of the attacker, considering the subsequent attacks by his opponents. In MCA, we target the Heterogeneous RecSys, where user-item interaction records, user social network, and item correlation graph are used for recommendations. To tackle MCA, we present the Multilevel Stackelberg Optimization over Progressive Differentiable Surrogate (MSOPDS). The Multilevel Stackelberg Optimization (MSO) method is used to form the optimum strategies by solving the Stackelberg game equilibrium between the attacker and his opponents, while the Progressive Differentiable Surrogate (PDS) addresses technical challenges in deriving gradients for candidate poisoning actions. Experiments on Heterogeneous RecSys trained with public datasets show that MSOPDS outperforms all examined prior works by up to 10.6% in average predicted ratings and up to 11.4% in HitRate@3 for an item targeted by an attacker facing one opponent.

Instant Representation Learning for Recommendation over Large Dynamic Graphs,"Recommender systems are able to learn user preferences based on user and item representations via their historical behaviors. To improve representation learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from various behavior types exhibited by users. In real-world scenarios, the user behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, i.e., the graph evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or deleted, which causes the Neighborhood Disturbance. Nevertheless, most existing methods neglect such streaming dynamics and thus need to be retrained once the graph has significantly evolved, making them unsuitable in the online learning environment. Furthermore, the Neighborhood Disturbance existing in dynamic graphs deteriorates the performance of neighbor-aggregation based graph models. To this end, we propose SUPA, a novel graph neural network for dynamic multiplex heterogeneous graphs. Compared to neighbor-aggregation architecture, SUPA develops a sample-update-propagate architecture to alleviate neighborhood disturbance. Specifically, for each new edge, SUPA samples an influenced subgraph, updates the representations of the two interactive nodes, and propagates the interaction information to the sampled subgraph. Furthermore, to train SUPA incrementally online, we propose InsLearn, an efficient workflow for single-pass training of large dynamic graphs. Extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets show that SUPA has a good generalization ability and is superior to sixteen state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Decoupled Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation,"Side information fusion for sequential recommendation (SR) aims to effectively leverage various side information to enhance the performance of next-item prediction. Most state-of-the-art methods build on self-attention networks and focus on exploring various solutions to integrate the item embedding and side information embeddings before the attention layer. However, our analysis shows that the early integration of various types of embeddings limits the expressiveness of attention matrices due to a rank bottleneck and constrains the flexibility of gradients. Also, it involves mixed correlations among the different heterogeneous information resources, which brings extra disturbance to attention calculation. Motivated by this, we propose Decoupled Side Information Fusion for Sequential Recommendation (DIF-SR), which moves the side information from the input to the attention layer and decouples the attention calculation of various side information and item representation. We theoretically and empirically show that the proposed solution allows higher-rank attention matrices and flexible gradients to enhance the modeling capacity of side information fusion. Also, auxiliary attribute predictors are proposed to further activate the beneficial interaction between side information and item representation learning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed solution stably outperforms state-of-the-art SR models. Further studies show that our proposed solution can be readily incorporated into current attention-based SR models and significantly boost performance.

KETCH: Knowledge Graph Enhanced Thread Recommendation in Healthcare Forums,"Health thread recommendation methods aim to suggest the most relevant existing threads for a user. Most of the existing methods tend to rely on modeling the post contents to retrieve relevant answers. However, some posts written by users with different clinical conditions can be lexically similar, as unrelated diseases (e.g., Angina and Osteoporosis) may have the same symptoms (e.g., back pain), yet irrelevant threads to a user. Therefore, it is critical to not only consider the connections between users and threads, but also the descriptions of users' symptoms and clinical conditions. In this paper, towards this problem of thread recommendation in online healthcare forums, we propose a knowledge graph enhanced Threads Recommendation (KETCH) model, which leverages graph neural networks to model the interactions among users and threads, and learn their representations. In our model, the users, threads and posts are three types of nodes in a graph, linked through their associations. KETCH uses the message passing strategy by aggregating information along with the network. In addition, we introduce a knowledge-enhanced attention mechanism to capture the latent conditions and symptoms. We also apply the method to the task of predicting the side effects of drugs, to show that KETCH has the potential to complement the medical knowledge graph. Comparing with the best results of seven competing methods, in terms of MRR, KETCH outperforms all methods by at least 0.125 on the MedHelp dataset, 0.048 on the Patient dataset and 0.092 on HealthBoards dataset, respectively. We release the source code of KETCH at: https: //github.com/cuilimeng/KETCH. © 2022 ACM."
Improving Accuracy and Diversity in Matching of Recommendation With Diversified Preference Network,"Real-world recommendation systems need to deal with millions of item candidates. Therefore, most practical large-scale recommendation systems usually contain two modules. The matching module aims to efficiently retrieve hundreds of high-quality items from large corpora, while the ranking module aims to generate specific ranks for these items. Recommendation diversity is an essential factor that strongly impacts user experience. There are lots of efforts that have explored recommendation diversity in ranking, while the matching module should take more responsibility for diversity. In this article, we propose a novel Heterogeneous graph neural network framework for diversified recommendation (GraphDR) in matching to improve both recommendation accuracy and diversity. Specifically, GraphDR builds a huge heterogeneous preference network to record different types of user preferences, and conducts a field-level heterogeneous graph attention network for node aggregation. We conduct a neighbor-similarity based loss with a multi-channel matching to improve both accuracy and diversity. In experiments, we conduct extensive online and offline evaluations on a real-world recommendation system with various accuracy and diversity metrics and achieve significant improvements. GraphDR has been deployed on a well-known recommendation system named WeChat Top Stories, which affects millions of users. The source code will be released in https://github.com/lqfarmer/GraphDR.  © 2015 IEEE."
GraphRR: A multiplex Graph based Reciprocal friend Recommender system with applications on online gaming service,"Reciprocal Recommender Systems (RRSs) are recommender systems specifically designed for people-to-people recommendation tasks, e.g., online gaming, dating, and recruitment services. They are fundamentally different from the conventional user–item recommendations. In RRSs, user interactions are usually directional, i.e., they are initiated by one side and not necessarily reciprocated by the other side. In the meanwhile, abundant multiplex user interactions, e.g., Friend Request and Send Message, are collated by the online services and can be represented into a large-scale multiplex user interaction graph. Despite the substantial progress of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on capturing users’ multiplex interactions, naive GNNs are insufficient to capture the additional information implied from the directions of interactions, as they are usually not designed to preserve the asymmetric proximities between users. In the paper, we present a novel Graph neural network for Reciprocal Recommendation (GraphRR) to utilize the multiplex user interactions. Specifically, three ego graphs are augmented based on the directions of interactions for each user to capture his preference, attraction and similarity in a finer granularity. Then the multiplexity-aware GNN modules are further applied to measure the contributions of different interaction types. Extensive experiments are conducted in the datasets of the real-world large-scale online games from NetEase Games, a leading game provider for worldwide users. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GraphRR over baseline methods and provide empirical evidence for the benefits of the proposed ego graph augmentation.

Rethinking transition relationship between co-occurring items in graph neural networks for session-based recommendation,"Session-based recommendation aims to recommend items based on anonymous behavior sequences. A session is generally modeled as a sequential structure or graph structure to extract its session-level representation. However, directly modeling a session as a sequence ignores the co-occurrence relationship between pairwise items, and current graph-based methods do not consider information transition directions sufficiently when calculating the similarity of co-occurring items. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, dubbed Item Transition Relationship Graph Neural Networks (ITR-GNN), to model different transition relationships between co-occurring items in an effective way, for better extracting user intents of current sessions. In ITR-GNN, session sequences are modeled as directed unweighted graphs, and two different transition relationships between a pair of co-occurring items are distinguished by two different concatenations of their latent vectors, according to the direction of the edge between them. In addition, we notice that the data used for session-based recommendation contain many noisy labels, degrading recommendation effects. Thereby, we introduce a label distillation strategy to learn improved soft labels and replace potential noisy labels through a teacher–student network. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the ITR-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Contrastive Cross-domain Recommendation in Matching,"Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to provide better recommendation results in the target domain with the help of the source domain, which is widely used and explored in real-world systems. However, CDR in the matching (i.e., candidate generation) module struggles with the data sparsity and popularity bias issues in both representation learning and knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel Contrastive Cross-Domain Recommendation (CCDR) framework for CDR in matching. Specifically, we build a huge diversified preference network to capture multiple information reflecting user diverse interests, and design an intra-domain contrastive learning (intra-CL) and three inter-domain contrastive learning (inter-CL) tasks for better representation learning and knowledge transfer. The intra-CL enables more effective and balanced training inside the target domain via a graph augmentation, while the inter-CL builds different types of cross-domain interactions from user, taxonomy, and neighbor aspects. In experiments, CCDR achieves significant improvements on both offline and online evaluations in a real-world system. Currently, we have deployed our CCDR on WeChat Top Stories, affecting plenty of users. The source code is in https://github.com/lqfarmer/CCDR.  © 2022 ACM."
Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer for Recommender Systems,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown as promising solutions for collaborative filtering (CF) with the modeling of user-item interaction graphs. The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues.

SPEX: A Generic Framework for Enhancing Neural Social Recommendation,"Social Recommender Systems (SRS) have attracted considerable attention since its accompanying service, social networks, helps increase user satisfaction and provides auxiliary information to improve recommendations. However, most existing SRS focus on social influence and ignore another essential social phenomenon, i.e., social homophily. Social homophily, which is the premise of social influence, indicates that people tend to build social relations with similar people and form influence propagation paths. In this article, we propose a generic framework Social PathExplorer (SPEX) to enhance neural SRS. SPEX treats the neural recommendation model as a black box and improves the quality of recommendations by modeling the social recommendation task, the formation of social homophily, and their mutual effect in the manner of multi-task learning. We design a Graph Neural Network based component for influence propagation path prediction to help SPEX capture the rich information conveyed by the formation of social homophily. We further propose an uncertainty based task balancing method to set appropriate task weights for the recommendation task and the path prediction task during the joint optimization. Extensive experiments have validated that SPEX can be easily plugged into various state-of-the-art neural recommendation models and help improve their performance.

EfficientRec: An Unlimited User Scale Recommendation System Based on Clustering and User’s Interaction Embedding Profile,"Recommendation systems are highly interested in technology companies nowadays. The businesses are constantly growing users and products, causing the number of users and items to continuously increase over time, to very large numbers. Traditional recommendation algorithms with complexity dependent on the number of users and items make them difficult to adapt to the industrial environment. In this paper, we introduce a new method applying graph neural networks with a contrastive learning framework in extracting user preferences. We incorporate a soft clustering architecture that significantly reduces the computational cost of the inference process. Experiments show that the model is able to learn user preferences with low computational cost in both training and prediction phases. At the same time, the model gives a very good accuracy. We call this architecture EfficientRec (Our source code available at: https://github.com/quanvu0996/EfficientRec ) with the implication of model compactness and the ability to scale to unlimited users and products. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
Job Recommendation Based on Multiple Behaviors and Explicit Preferences,"A lot of job openings have been released online, which makes job recommendation more and more important. Recently, users often enter their preferences into job search websites to receive some job recommendations that they hope to apply for. To achieve this goal, the following two types of data are available: (1) auxiliary behavior data such as viewing job postings, bookmarking them and (2) explicit preference data such as conditions for a job that each user desires. Some researchers propose job recommendation by addressing either of them. However, they have not focused on simultaneously addressing both (1) and (2) so far. Given this point, we propose a method for job recommendation that employs auxiliary behavior data and each user's explicit preference data simultaneously. Additionally, our proposed method addresses multiple behavior overlaps and refines the latent representations. Experimental results on our dataset constructed from an actual job search website show that our proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-arts as measured by MRR and nDCG.

Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network-Based Software Developer Recommendation,"In software maintenance, it is critical for project managers to assign software issues to the appropriate developers. However, finding suitable developers is challenging due to the general sparsity and the long-tail of developer-issue interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network-based method for Developer Recommendation (called HGDR), in which text information embedding and self-supervised learning (SSL) are incorporated. Specifically, to alleviate the sparsity of developer-issue interactions, we unify developer-issue interactions, developer-source code file interactions and issue-source code file relations into a heterogeneous graph, and we embed text descriptions to graph nodes as information supplements. In addition, to mitigate the long-tail influence, e.g., recommendation bias, the proficiency weight suppression link supplementation is proposed to complement the tail developers by adjusting proficiency weights. Finally, to fully utilize rich structural information of heterogeneous graph, we use the joint learning of metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network and SSL to learn the embedding representation. Extensive comparison experiments on three real-world datasets show that HGDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 6.02% to 44.27% on recommended metric. The experimental results also demonstrate the efficacy of HGDR in the sparse and long-tail scenario.

Fast Library Recommendation in Software Dependency Graphs with Symmetric Partially Absorbing Random Walks,"To help developers discover libraries suited to their software projects, automated approaches often start from already employed libraries and recommend more based on co-occurrence patterns in other projects. The most accurate project–library recommendation systems employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that learn latent node representations for link prediction. However, GNNs need to be retrained when dependency graphs are updated, for example, to recommend libraries for new projects, and are thus unwieldy for scalable deployment. To avoid retraining, we pro-pose that recommendations can instead be performed with graph filters; by analyzing dependency graph dynamics emulating human-driven library discovery, we identify low-pass filtering with memory as a promising direction and introduce a novel filter, called symmetric partially absorbing random walks, which infers rather than trains the parameters of filters with node-specific memory to guarantee low-pass filtering. Experiments on a dependency graph between Android projects and third-party libraries show that our approach makes recommendations with a quality and diversifica-tion loosely comparable to those state-of-the-art GNNs without computationally intensive retraining for new predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

Graph neural networks with global noise filtering for session-based recommendation,"Session-based recommendation leverages anonymous sessions to predict which item a user is most likely to click on next. While previous approaches capture items-transition patterns within current session and neighbor sessions, they do not accurately filter out noise within session or widen the range of feasible data in a more reasonable way. In a current session, the user may accidentally click on an unrelated item, resulting in the fact that, the users’ primary intents from neighbor sessions, may mismatch the current session. Thereby, we propose a new framework, dubbed Graph Neural Networks with Global Noise Filtering for Session-based Recommendation (GNN-GNF), aiming to filter noisy data and exploit items-transition patterns in a more comprehensive and reasonable manner. In simple terms, GNN-GNF contains two parts: data preprocessing and model learning. In data preprocesing, an item-level filter module is used to obtain the main intent of user and a session-level filter module is designed to filter the sessions unrelated to the target session intent by means of edge matching. In model learning, we consider both local-level interest obtained by an aggregation of the items representing the main intent of user within a session, and global-level interest deduced from a global graph. We take two kinds of neighbor aggregations, summation and interactive aggregation, respectively, to iteratively derive the representation of the central node in the global graph. Finally, GNN-GNF concatenates the local and global preference to characterize the current session, towards better recommendation prediction. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that GNN-GNF can achieve competitive results. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Fenglixia/GNF. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
Improvement Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering with Weighted Addition Input,"Graph Neural Networks have been extensively applied in the field of machine learning to find features of graphs, and recommendation systems are no exception. The ratings of users on considered items can be represented by graphs which are input for many efficient models to find out the characteristics of the users and the items. From these insights, relevant items are recommended to users. However, user’s decisions on the items have varying degrees of effects on different users, and this information should be learned so as not to be lost in the process of information mining. In this publication, we propose to build an additional graph showing the recommended weight of an item to a target user to improve the accuracy of GNN models. Although the users’ friendships were not recorded, their correlation was still evident through the commonalities in consumption behavior. We build a model WiGCN (Weighted input GCN) to describe and experiment on well-known datasets. Conclusions will be stated after comparing our results with state-of-the-art such as GCMC, NGCF and LightGCN.

Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning with Social Tie for Personalized POI Recommendation,"Recommending a limited number of Point-of-Interests (POIs) a user will visit next has become increasingly important to both users and POI holders for Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs). However, POI recommendation is a challenging task since complex sequential patterns and rich contexts are contained in extremely sparse user check-in data. Recent studies show that embedding techniques effectively incorporate POI contextual information to alleviate the data sparsity issue, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been successfully employed for sequential prediction. Nevertheless, existing POI recommendation approaches are still limited in capturing user personalized preference due to separate embedding learning or network modeling. To this end, we propose a novel unified spatio-temporal neural network framework, named PPR, which leverages users’ check-in records and social ties to recommend personalized POIs for querying users by joint embedding and sequential modeling. Specifically, PPR first learns user and POI representations by joint modeling User-POI relation, sequential patterns, geographical influence, and social ties in a heterogeneous graph and then models user personalized sequential patterns using the designed spatio-temporal neural network based on LSTM model for the personalized POI recommendation. Furthermore, we extend PPR to an end-to-end recommendation model by jointly learning node representations and modeling user personalized sequential preference. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for successive POI recommendation in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and NDCG.

Graph Meta Network for Multi-Behavior Recommendation,"Modern recommender systems often embed users and items into low-dimensional latent representations, based on their observed interactions. In practical recommendation scenarios, users often exhibit various intents which drive them to interact with items with multiple behavior types (e.g., click, tag-as-favorite, purchase). However, the diversity of user behaviors is ignored in most of existing approaches, which makes them difficult to capture heterogeneous relational structures across different types of interactive behaviors. Exploring multi-typed behavior patterns is of great importance to recommendation systems, yet is very challenging because of two aspects: i) The complex dependencies across different types of user-item interactions; ii) Diversity of such multi-behavior patterns may vary by users due to their personalized preference. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a Multi-Behavior recommendation framework with Graph Meta Network to incorporate the multi-behavior pattern modeling into a meta-learning paradigm. Our developed MB-GMN empowers the user-item interaction learning with the capability of uncovering type-dependent behavior representations, which automatically distills the behavior heterogeneity and interaction diversity for recommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MB-GMN by significantly boosting the recommendation performance as compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

DMBGN: Deep Multi-Behavior Graph Networks for Voucher Redemption Rate Prediction,"In E-commerce, vouchers are important marketing tools to enhance users' engagement and boost sales and revenue. The likelihood that a user redeems a voucher is a key factor in voucher distribution decision. User-item Click-Through-Rate (CTR) models are often applied to predict the user-voucher redemption rate. However, the voucher scenario involves more complicated relations among users, items and vouchers. The users' historical behavior in a voucher collection activity reflects users' voucher usage patterns, which is nevertheless overlooked by the CTR-based solutions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-behavior Graph Networks (DMBGN) to shed light on this field for the voucher redemption rate prediction. The complex structural user-voucher-item relationships are captured by a User-Behavior Voucher Graph (UVG). User behavior happening both before and after voucher collection is taken into consideration, and a high-level representation is extracted by Higher-order Graph Neural Networks. On top of a sequence of UVGs, an attention network is built which can help to learn users' long-term voucher redemption preference. Extensive experiments on three large-scale production datasets demonstrate the proposed DMBGN model is effective, with 10% to 16% relative AUC improvement over Deep Neural Networks (DNN), and 2% to 4% AUC improvement over Deep Interest Network (DIN). Source code and a sample dataset are made publicly available to facilitate future research. © 2021 ACM."
Rethinking Adjacent Dependency in Session-Based Recommendations,"Session-based recommendations (SBRs) recommend the next item for an anonymous user by modeling the dependencies between items in a session. Benefiting from the superiority of graph neural networks (GNN) in learning complex dependencies, GNN-based SBRs have become the main stream of SBRs in recent years. Most GNN-based SBRs are based on a strong assumption of adjacent dependency, which means any two adjacent items in a session are necessarily dependent here. However, based on our observation, the adjacency does not necessarily indicate dependency due to the uncertainty and complexity of user behaviours. Therefore, the aforementioned assumption does not always hold in the real-world cases and thus easily leads to two deficiencies: (1) the introduction of false dependencies between items which are adjacent in a session but are not really dependent, and (2) the missing of true dependencies between items which are not adjacent but are actually dependent. Such deficiencies significantly downgrade accurate dependency learning and thus reduce the recommendation performance. Aiming to address these deficiencies, we propose a novel review-refined inter-item graph neural network (RI-GNN), which utilizes the topic information extracted from items’ reviews to refine dependencies between items. Experiments on two public real-world datasets demonstrate that RI-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (The implementation is available at https://github.com/Nishikata97/RI-GNN. ). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network for Recommender Systems,"As the deep learning techniques have expanded to real-world recommendation tasks, many deep neural network based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models have been developed to project user-item interactions into latent feature space, based on various neural architectures, such as multi-layer perceptron, autoencoder, and graph neural networks. However, the majority of existing collaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data. Particularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase, these solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item interactions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the recommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network (CRANet), that is capable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved user-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an integrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information fusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the ability of encoding implicit user's pairwise preference on both interacted and non-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based tied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the two-stage CRANetmodel. We finally experimentally validate CRANeton four diverse benchmark datasets corresponding to two recommendation tasks, to show that debiasing the negative signals of user-item interactions improves the performance as compared to various state-of-The-Art recommendation techniques.

Cold start similar artists ranking with gravity-inspired graph autoencoders,"On an artist's profile page, music streaming services frequently recommend a ranked list of ""similar artists""that fans also liked. However, implementing such a feature is challenging for new artists, for which usage data on the service (e.g. streams or likes) is not yet available. In this paper, we model this cold start similar artists ranking problem as a link prediction task in a directed and attributed graph, connecting artists to their top-k most similar neighbors and incorporating side musical information. Then, we leverage a graph autoencoder architecture to learn node embedding representations from this graph, and to automatically rank the top-k most similar neighbors of new artists using a gravity-inspired mechanism. We empirically show the flexibility and the effectiveness of our framework, by addressing a real-world cold start similar artists ranking problem on a global music streaming service. Along with this paper, we also publicly release our source code and the industrial data from our experiments.  © 2021 ACM."
User Response Prediction in Online Advertising,"Online advertising, as a vast market, has gained significant attention in various platforms ranging from search engines, third-party websites, social media, and mobile apps. The prosperity of online campaigns is a challenge in online marketing and is usually evaluated by user response through different metrics, such as clicks on advertisement (ad) creatives, subscriptions to products, purchases of items, or explicit user feedback through online surveys. Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of studies using computational approaches, including machine learning methods, for user response prediction. However, existing literature mainly focuses on algorithmic-driven designs to solve specific challenges, and no comprehensive review exists to answer many important questions. What are the parties involved in the online digital advertising eco-systems? What type of data are available for user response prediction? How do we predict user response in a reliable and/or transparent way? In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of user response prediction in online advertising and related recommender applications. Our essential goal is to provide a thorough understanding of online advertising platforms, stakeholders, data availability, and typical ways of user response prediction. We propose a taxonomy to categorize state-of-The-Art user response prediction methods, primarily focusing on the current progress of machine learning methods used in different online platforms. In addition, we also review applications of user response prediction, benchmark datasets, and open source codes in the field. © 2021 ACM."
Learning fair representations for recommendation: A graph-based perspective,"As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user's and each item's original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FairGo.  Â© 2021 ACM."
Object Interaction Recommendation with Multi-Modal Attention-based Hierarchical Graph Neural Network,"Object interaction recommendation from Internet of Things (IoT) is a crucial basis for IoT related applications. While many efforts are devoted to suggesting object for interaction, the majority of models rigidly infer relationships from human social network, overlook the neighbor information in their own object social network and the correlation of multiple heterogeneous features, and ignore multi-scale structure of the network. To tackle the above challenges, this work focuses on object social network, formulates object interaction recommendation as multi-modals object ranking, and proposes Multi-Modal Attention-based Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (MM-AHGNN), that describes object with multiple knowledge of actions and pairwise interaction feature, encodes heterogeneous actions with multi-modal encoder, integrates neighbor information and fuses correlative multi-modal feature by intra-modal hybrid-attention graph convolution and inter-modal transformer encoder, and employs multi-modal multi-scale encoder to integrate multi-level information, for suggesting object interaction more flexibly. With extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we prove that MMAHGNN achieves better recommendation results (improve 3-4% HR@3 and 4-5% NDCG@3) than the most advanced baseline. To our knowledge, our MM-AHGNN is the first research in GNN design for object interaction recommendation. Source codes are available at: https://github.com/gaosaroma/MM-AHGNN. © 2021 IEEE."
Multi-behavior enhanced recommendation with cross-interaction collaborative relation modeling,"Many previous studies aim to augment collaborative filtering with deep neural network techniques, so as to achieve better recommendation performance. However, most existing deep learning-based recommender systems are designed for modeling singular type of user-item interaction behavior, which can hardly distill the heterogeneous relations between user and item. In practical recommendation scenarios, there exist multi-typed user behaviors, such as browse and purchase. Due to the overlook of user's multi-behavioral patterns over different items, existing recommendation methods are insufficient to capture heterogeneous collaborative signals from user multi-behavior data. Inspired by the strength of graph neural networks for structured data modeling, this work proposes a Graph Neural Multi-Behavior Enhanced Recommendation (GNMR) framework which explicitly models the dependencies between different types of user-item interactions under a graph-based message passing architecture. GNMR devises a relation aggregation network to model interaction heterogeneity, and recursively performs embedding propagation between neighboring nodes over the user-item interaction graph. Experiments on real-world recommendation datasets show that our GNMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/akaxlh/GNMR. © 2021 IEEE."
Player Style Clustering without Game Variables,"Player clustering when applied to the field of video games has several potential applications. For example, the evaluation of the composition of a player base or the generation of AI agents with identified playing styles. These agents can then be used for either the testing of new game content or used directly to enhance a player's gaming experience. Most current player clustering techniques focus on the use of internal game variables. This raises two main issues: (1) the availability of game variables, as source code access is required to log them and hence limits the data sources that can be used, and (2) the choice of game variables can introduce unintended bias in the types of play style extracted. In this work, a hybrid unsupervised frame encoder and a 'reference-based' clustering algorithm are both proposed and combined to allow clustering from raw game play videos. It is shown that the proposed methods are most beneficial when the types of play styles are unknown. © 2020 Owner/Author."
Joint Graph Contextualized Network for Sequential Recommendation,"Sequential recommendation aims to suggest items to users based on sequential dependencies. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are recently proposed to capture transitions of items by treating session sequences as graph-structured data. However, existing graph construction approaches mainly focus on the directional dependency of items and ignore benefits of feature aggregation from undirectional relationship. In this paper, we innovatively propose a joint graph contextualized network (JGCN) for sequential recommendation, which constructs both the directed graphs and undirected graphs to jointly capture current interests and global preferences. Specifically, we introduce gate graph neural networks and model the combined embedding of weighted position and node information from directed graphs for capturing current interests. Besides, to learn global preferences, we propose a graph collaborative attention network with correlation-based similarity of items from undirected graphs. Finally, a feed-forward layer with the residual connection is applied to synthetically obtain accurate transitions of items. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets show that JGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Adversarial Training towards Robust Multimedia Recommender System,"With the prevalence of multimedia content on the Web, developing recommender solutions that can effectively leverage the rich signal in multimedia data is in urgent need. Owing to the success of deep neural networks in representation learning, recent advances on multimedia recommendation has largely focused on exploring deep learning methods to improve the recommendation accuracy. To date, however, there has been little effort to investigate the robustness of multimedia representation and its impact on the performance of multimedia recommendation. In this paper, we shed light on the robustness of multimedia recommender system. Using the state-of-the-art recommendation framework and deep image features, we demonstrate that the overall system is not robust, such that a small (but purposeful) perturbation on the input image will severely decrease the recommendation accuracy. This implies the possible weakness of multimedia recommender system in predicting user preference, and more importantly, the potential of improvement by enhancing its robustness. To this end, we propose a novel solution named Adversarial Multimedia Recommendation (AMR), which can lead to a more robust multimedia recommender model by using adversarial learning. The idea is to train the model to defend an adversary, which adds perturbations to the target image with the purpose of decreasing the model's accuracy. We conduct experiments on two representative multimedia recommendation tasks, namely, image recommendation and visually-aware product recommendation. Extensive results verify the positive effect of adversarial learning and demonstrate the effectiveness of our AMR method. Source codes are available in https://github.com/duxy-me/AMR. © 2020 IEEE."
Graph Embedding Based Session Perception Model for Next-Click Recommendation; [基于图表示学习的会话感知推荐模型],"Predicting users' next-click according to their historical session records, also known as session-based recommendation, is an important and challenging task and has led to a considerable amount of work towards this aim. Several significant progresses have been made in this area, but some fundamental problems still remain open, such as the trade-off between users' satisfaction and predictive accuracy of the models. In this study, we consider the problem of how to alleviate user interests drift without sacrificing the predictive accuracy. For this purpose, we first set up an item dependency graph to represent the click sequence of items from a global, statistical perspective. Then an efficient graph embedding learning algorithm is proposed to produce item embeddings which preserve the information flow properties of the system and the structural dependency between each pair of items. Finally, the proposed model is capable of capturing the users' general interests and their temporal browsing interests simultaneously by using of a BiLSTM based long/short term memory mechanism. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that the proposed model not only performs better in terms of predictive accuracy but also demonstrates better diversity and novelty in its recommendations as compared with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Science Press.

Knowledge-aware Coupled Graph Neural Network for Social Recommendation,"Social recommendation task aims to predict users’ preferences over items with the incorporation of social connections among users, so as to alleviate the sparse issue of collaborative filtering. While many recent efforts show the effectiveness of neural network-based social recommender systems, several important challenges have not been well addressed yet: (i) The majority of models only consider users’ social connections, while ignoring the inter-dependent knowledge across items; (ii) Most of existing solutions are designed for singular type of user-item interactions, making them infeasible to capture the interaction heterogeneity; (iii) The dynamic nature of user-item interactions has been less explored in many social-aware recommendation techniques. To tackle the above challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-aware Coupled Graph Neural Network (KCGN) that jointly injects the inter-dependent knowledge across items and users into the recommendation framework. KCGN enables the high-order user- and item-wise relation encoding by exploiting the mutual information for global graph structure awareness. Additionally, we further augment KCGN with the capability of capturing dynamic multi-typed user-item interactive patterns. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our method against many strong baselines in a variety of settings.

Segregating feature interfaces to support software product line maintenance,"Although software product lines are widely used in practice, their maintenance is challenging. Features as units of behaviour can be heavily scattered across the source code of a product line, hindering modular reasoning. To alleviate this problem, feature interfaces aim at enhancing modular reasoning about features. However, considering all members of a feature interface is often cumbersome, especially due to the large number of members arising in practice. To address this problem, we present an approach to group members of a feature interface based on their mutual dependencies. We argue that often only a subset of all interface members is relevant to a maintenance task. Therefore, we propose a graph representation that is able to capture the collaboration between members and apply a clustering algorithm to it to group highly-related members and segregate non-related members. On a set of ten versions of a real-world product line, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, by comparing the two types of feature interfaces (segregated vs. original interfaces) with co-change information from the version-control system. We found a potential reduction of 62% of the interface members to be considered during maintenance. © 2016 ACM."
