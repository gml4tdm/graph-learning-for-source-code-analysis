Ou W.; Ding S.H.H.; Tian Y.; Song L.,SCS-Gan: Learning Functionality-Agnostic Stylometric Representations for Source Code Authorship Verification,"In recent years, the number of anonymous script-based fileless malware attacks and software copyright disputes has increased rapidly. In the literature, automated Code Authorship Analysis (CAA) techniques have been proposed to reduce the manual effort in identifying those attacks and issues. Most CAA techniques aim to solve the task of Authorship Attribution (AA), i.e., identifying the actual author of a source code fragment from a given set of candidate authors. However, in many real-world scenarios, investigators do not have a predefined set of authors containing the actual author at the time of investigation, i.e., contradicting AA's assumption. Additionally, existing AA techniques ignore the influence of code functionality when identifying the authorship, which leads to biased matching simply based on code functionality. Different from AA, the task of (extreme) Authorship Verification (AV) is to decide if two texts were written by the same person or not. AV techniques do not need a predefined author set and thus could be applied in more code authorship-related applications than AA. To our knowledge, there is no previous work attempting to solve the AV problem for the source code. To fill the gap, we propose a novel adversarial neural network, namely SCS-Gan, that can learn a stylometric representation of code for automated AV. With the multi-head attention mechanism, SCS-Gan focuses on the code parts that are most informative regarding personal styles and generates functionality-agnostic stylometric representations through adversarial training. We benchmark SCS-Gan and two state-of-the-art code representation models on four out-of-sample datasets collected from a real-world programming competition. Our experiment results show that SCS-Gan outperforms the baselines on all four out-of-sample datasets.  © IEEE 1976-2012.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130812596&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2022.3177228&partnerID=40&md5=2bd3b051420a8f0607a0bcb3b9489a81,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,Yes,Exclude,E2.1,"","",""
do Rosario V.M.; da Silva A.F.; Zanella A.F.; Napoli O.O.; Borin E.,Fast selection of compiler optimizations using performance prediction with graph neural networks,"Tuning application performance on modern computing infrastructures involves choices in a vast design space as modern computing architectures can have several complex structures impacting performance. Moreover, different applications use these structures in different ways, leading to a challenging performance function. Consequently, it is hard for compilers or experts to find optimal compilation parameters for an application that maximizes such performance function. One approach to tackle this problem is to evaluate many possible optimization plans and select the best among them. However, executing an application to measure its performance for every plan can be very expensive. To tackle this problem, previous work has investigated the use of Machine Learning techniques to predict the performance of the applications without executing them quickly. In this work, we evaluate the use of graph neural networks (GNN) to make fast predictions without executing the application to guide the selection of good optimization sequences. We propose a GNN architecture to make such predictions. We train and test it using 30 thousand different compilation plans applied to 300 different applications, using ARM64 and LLVM IR code representations as input. Our results indicate that the control and data flow graph can then learn features from the control and data flow graph to outperform nongraph-aware Machine Learning models. Our GNN architecture achieved 91% accuracy in our dataset compared to 79% when using a nongraph-aware architecture–taking only 16ms to predict a given input. If the application been optimized took an average of 10 s to execute, and we evaluated 1000 optimization sequences, it would take almost 9 h to assess all pairs, but only 16 s with our GNN. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126280581&doi=10.1002%2fcpe.6869&partnerID=40&md5=f8fab966abd61e95953dbe4237b61fb7,Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience,Yes,Exclude,E1.5,"",Exclude,
Mi Q.; Zhan Y.; Weng H.; Bao Q.; Cui L.; Ma W.,A graph-based code representation method to improve code readability classification,"Context: Code readability is crucial for developers since it is closely related to code maintenance and affects developers’ work efficiency. Code readability classification refers to the source code being classified as pre-defined certain levels according to its readability. So far, many code readability classification models have been proposed in existing studies, including deep learning networks that have achieved relatively high accuracy and good performance. Objective: However, in terms of representation, these methods lack effective preservation of the syntactic and semantic structure of the source code. To extract these features, we propose a graph-based code representation method. Method: Firstly, the source code is parsed into a graph containing its abstract syntax tree (AST) combined with control and data flow edges to reserve the semantic structural information and then we convert the graph nodes’ source code and type information into vectors. Finally, we train our graph neural networks model composing Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), DMoNPooling, and K-dimensional Graph Neural Networks (k-GNNs) layers to extract these features from the program graph. Result: We evaluate our approach to the task of code readability classification using a Java dataset provided by Scalabrino et al. (2016). The results show that our method achieves 72.5% and 88% in three-class and two-class classification accuracy, respectively. Conclusion: We are the first to introduce graph-based representation into code readability classification. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art readability models, which suggests that the graph-based code representation method is effective in extracting syntactic and semantic information from source code, and ultimately improves code readability classification. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160003449&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-023-10319-6&partnerID=40&md5=123f5324dfc79038a0d3244e8c791cab,Empirical Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Pian W.; Peng H.; Tang X.; Sun T.; Tian H.; Habib A.; Klein J.; Bissyandé T.F.,MetaTPTrans: A Meta Learning Approach for Multilingual Code Representation Learning,"Representation learning of source code is essential for applying machine learning to software engineering tasks. Learning code representation from a multilingual source code dataset has been shown to be more effective than learning from single-language datasets separately, since more training data from multilingual dataset improves the model’s ability to extract language-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multilingual training overlooks the language-specific information which is crucial for modeling source code across different programming languages, while only focusing on learning a unified model with shared parameters among different languages for language-agnostic information modeling. To address this problem, we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code representation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for the feature extractor according to the specific programming language type of the input code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostic and language-specific information with dynamic parameters in the feature extractor. We conduct experiments on the code summarization and code completion tasks to verify the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach with significant improvements on state-of-the-art baselines. p g .

Dutta A.; Alcaraz J.; Tehranijamsaz A.; Cesar E.; Sikora A.; Jannesari A.,Performance Optimization using Multimodal Modeling and Heterogeneous GNN,"Growing heterogeneity and configurability in HPC architectures has made auto-tuning applications and runtime parameters on these systems very complex. Users are presented with a multitude of options to configure parameters. In addition to application specific solutions, a common approach is to use general purpose search strategies, which often might not identify the best configurations or their time to convergence is a significant barrier. There is, thus, a need for a general purpose and efficient tuning approach that can be easily scaled and adapted to various tuning tasks. We propose a technique for tuning parallel code regions that is general enough to be adapted to multiple tasks. In this paper, we analyze IR-based programming models to make task-specific performance optimizations. To this end, we propose the Multimodal Graph Neural Network and Autoencoder (MGA) tuner, a multimodal deep learning based approach that adapts Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks and Denoising Autoencoders for modeling IR-based code representations that serve as separate modalities. This approach is used as part of our pipeline to model a syntax, semantics, and structure-aware IR-based code representation for tuning parallel code regions/kernels. We extensively experiment on OpenMP and OpenCL code regions/kernels obtained from PolyBench, Rodinia, STREAM, DataRaceBench, AMD SDK, NPB, NVIDIA SDK, Parboil, SHOC, LULESH, XSBench, RSBench, miniFE, miniAMR, and Quicksilver benchmarks and applications. We apply our multimodal learning techniques to the tasks of (i) optimizing the number of threads, scheduling policy and chunk size in OpenMP loops and, (ii) identifying the best device for heterogeneous device mapping of OpenCL kernels. Our experiments show that this multimodal learning based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in almost all experiments.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169596772&doi=10.1145%2f3588195.3592984&partnerID=40&md5=8541d5da24bd5e4f2d9ac83d29a5b658,HPDC 2023 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing,Yes,Exclude,E1.5,"","",""
Ding Z.; Li H.; Shang W.; Chen T.-H.P.,Towards Learning Generalizable Code Embeddings Using Task-agnostic Graph Convolutional Networks,"Code embeddings have seen increasing applications in software engineering (SE) research and practice recently. Despite the advances in embedding techniques applied in SE research, one of the main challenges is their generalizability. A recent study finds that code embeddings may not be readily leveraged for the downstream tasks that the embeddings are not particularly trained for. Therefore, in this article, we propose GraphCodeVec, which represents the source code as graphs and leverages the Graph Convolutional Networks to learn more generalizable code embeddings in a task-agnostic manner. The edges in the graph representation are automatically constructed from the paths in the abstract syntax trees, and the nodes from the tokens in the source code. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphCodeVec , we consider three downstream benchmark tasks (i.e., code comment generation, code authorship identification, and code clones detection) that are used in a prior benchmarking of code embeddings and add three new downstream tasks (i.e., source code classification, logging statements prediction, and software defect prediction), resulting in a total of six downstream tasks that are considered in our evaluation. For each downstream task, we apply the embeddings learned by GraphCodeVec and the embeddings learned from four baseline approaches and compare their respective performance. We find that GraphCodeVec outperforms all the baselines in five out of the six downstream tasks, and its performance is relatively stable across different tasks and datasets. In addition, we perform ablation experiments to understand the impacts of the training context (i.e., the graph context extracted from the abstract syntax trees) and the training model (i.e., the Graph Convolutional Networks) on the effectiveness of the generated embeddings. The results show that both the graph context and the Graph Convolutional Networks can benefit GraphCodeVec in producing high-quality embeddings for the downstream tasks, while the improvement by Graph Convolutional Networks is more robust across different downstream tasks and datasets. Our findings suggest that future research and practice may consider using graph-based deep learning methods to capture the structural information of the source code for SE tasks.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153731394&doi=10.1145%2f3542944&partnerID=40&md5=5579536a2ca56d11845228acae273057,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Zhang Z.; Lei Y.; Mao X.; Yan M.; Xia X.; Lo D.,Context-Aware Neural Fault Localization,"Numerous fault localization techniques identify suspicious statements potentially responsible for program failures by discovering the statistical correlation between test results (i.e., failing or passing) and the executions of the different statements of a program (i.e., covered or not covered). They rarely incorporate a failure context into their suspiciousness evaluation despite the fact that a failure context showing how a failure is produced is useful for analyzing and locating faults. Since a failure context usually contains the transitive relationships among the statements of causing a failure, its relationship complexity becomes one major obstacle for the context incorporation in suspiciousness evaluation of fault localization. To overcome the obstacle, our insight is that leveraging the promising learning ability may be a candidate solution to learn a feasible model for incorporating a failure context into fault localization. Thus, we propose a context-aware neural fault localization approach (CAN). Specifically, CAN represents the failure context by constructing a program dependency graph, which shows how a set of statements interact with each other (i.e., data and control dependencies) to cause a failure. Then, CAN utilizes graph neural networks to analyze and incorporate the context (e.g., the dependencies among the statements) into suspiciousness evaluation. Our empirical results on the 12 large-sized programs show that CAN achieves promising results (e.g., 29.23% faults are ranked within top 5), and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art baselines with a substantial margin.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161081310&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2023.3279125&partnerID=40&md5=0d45c583f7c58af9023ec05c2b6ae585,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,Yes,Exclude,E1.3,"","",""
Dong Z.; Hu Q.; Zhang Z.; Zhao J.,On the Effectiveness of Graph Data Augmentation for Source Code Learning,"The methodology that uses deep learning to solve software engineering tasks, such as bug detection, is known as source code learning. Due to the graph nature of source code, graph learning, empowered by graph neural networks (GNNs), has been increasingly adopted for source code learning. Like other deep learning contexts, source code learning also relies on massive high-quality training data, and the shortage of such data has become the main performance bottleneck. In practice, data augmentation is often used as a countermeasure to mitigate this issue, by synthesizing additional training data based on existing ones. However, most existing practice of data augmentation in source code learning limits simple code refactoring methods and is not sufficiently effective. In this work, in light of the graph nature of source code, we propose to apply the data augmentation methods used for graph-structured data in graph learning to the tasks of source code learning, and we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate whether such new ways of data augmentation are more effective than the existing simple code refactoring methods. Specifically, we evaluate 4 critical software engineering tasks and 7 neural network architectures to assess the effectiveness of 5 data augmentation methods. Experimental results identify that, compared to other methods, Manifold-Mixup can greatly improve the accuracy of the trained models for source code learning.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179522132&doi=10.1109%2fDSA59317.2023.00124&partnerID=40&md5=86fc4890726e94127df716a7a57d61d1,"Proceedings - 2023 10th International Conference on Dependable Systems and Their Applications, DSA 2023",Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Pan W.; Ming H.; Kim D.-K.; Yang Z.,Pride: Prioritizing Documentation Effort Based on a PageRank-Like Algorithm and Simple Filtering Rules,"Code documentation can be helpful in many software quality assurance tasks. However, due to resource constraints (e.g., time, human resources, and budget), programmers often cannot document their work completely and timely. In the literature, two approaches (one is supervised and the other is unsupervised) have been proposed to prioritize documentation effort to ensure the most important classes to be documented first. However, both of them contain several limitations. The supervised approach overly relies on a difficult-to-obtain labeled data set and has high computation cost. The unsupervised one depends on a graph representation of the software structure, which is inaccurate since it neglects many important couplings between classes. In this paper, we propose an improved approach, named Pride, to prioritize documentation effort. First, Pride uses a weighted directed class coupling network to precisely describe classes and their couplings. Second, we propose a PageRank-like algorithm to quantify the importance of classes in the whole class coupling network. Third, we use a set of software metrics to quantify source code complexity and further propose a simple but easy-to-operate filtering rule. Fourth, we sort all the classes according to their importance in descending order and use the filtering rule to filter out unimportant classes. Finally, a threshold kk is utilized, and the top-kk% ranked classes are the identified important classes to be documented first. Empirical results on a set of nine software systems show that, according to the average ranking of the Friedman test, Pride is superior to the existing approaches in the whole data set.  © 2022 IEEE.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129670613&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2022.3171469&partnerID=40&md5=346cf30e57b601387a769a9b0f781a8d,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

Liu J.; Zeng J.; Wang X.; Liang Z.,Learning Graph-based Code Representations for Source-level Functional Similarity Detection,"Detecting code functional similarity forms the basis of various software engineering tasks. However, the detection is challenging as functionally similar code fragments can be implemented differently, e.g., with irrelevant syntax. Recent studies incorporate program dependencies as semantics to identify syntactically different yet semantically similar programs, but they often focus only on local neighborhoods (e.g., one-hop dependencies), limiting the expressiveness of program semantics in modeling functionalities. In this paper, we present Tailor that explicitly exploits deep graph-structured code features for functional similarity detection. Given source-level programs, Tailor first represents them into code property graphs (CPGs) - which combine abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs, and data flow graphs - to collectively reason about program syntax and semantics. Then, Tailor learns representations of CPGs by applying a CPG-based neural network (CPGNN) to iteratively propagate information on them. It improves over prior work on code representation learning through a new graph neural network (GNN) tailored to CPG structures instead of the off-the-shelf GNNs used previously. We systematically evaluate Tailor on C and Java programs using two public benchmarks. Experimental results show that Tailor outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 99.8% and 99.9% F-scores in code clone detection and 98.3% accuracy in source code classification. © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171745038&doi=10.1109%2fICSE48619.2023.00040&partnerID=40&md5=53a3e46dcfc8d8ebf0487b07fc1986f7,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,

Das D.; Mathews N.S.; Mathai A.; Tamilselvam S.; Sedamaki K.; Chimalakonda S.; Kumar A.,COMEX: A Tool for Generating Customized Source Code Representations,"Learning effective representations of source code is critical for any Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) system. Inspired by natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and CodeGen treat code as generic sequences of text and are trained on huge corpora of code data, achieving state of the art performance on several software engineering (SE) tasks. However, valid source code, unlike natural language, follows a strict structure and pattern governed by the underlying grammar of the programming language. Current LLMs do not exploit this property of the source code as they treat code like a sequence of tokens and overlook key structural and semantic properties of code that can be extracted from code-views like the Control Flow Graph (CFG), Data Flow Graph (DFG), Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), etc. Unfortunately, the process of generating and integrating code-views for every programming language is cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this barrier, we propose our tool COMEX - a framework that allows researchers and developers to create and combine multiple code-views which can be used by machine learning (ML) models for various SE tasks. Some salient features of our tool are: (i) it works directly on source code (which need not be compilable), (ii) it currently supports Java and C#, (iii) it can analyze both method-level snippets and program-level snippets by using both intra-procedural and inter-procedural analysis, and (iv) it is easily extendable to other languages as it is built on tree-sitter - a widely used incremental parser that supports over 40 languages. We believe this easy-to-use code-view generation and customization tool will give impetus to research in source code representation learning methods and ML4SE.

Most existing techniques treat source code as a sequence of tokens or abstract syntax trees. Consequently, they cannot incorporate semantic contextual information pertaining to a buggy line of code and its fix. In this work, we propose a program repair technique called GLANCE that combines static program analysis with graph-to-sequence learning for capturing contextual information. To represent contextual information, we introduce a graph representation that can encode information about the buggy code and its repair ingredients by embedding control and data flow information. We employ a fine-grained graphical code representation, which explicitly describes code change context and embeds semantic relationships between code elements. GLANCE leverages a graph neural network and a sequence-based decoder to learn from this semantic code representation.

Various neural network models are proposed to learn from tree-structured program representations, e.g., abstract syntax tree (AST) and concrete syntax tree (CST). However, most neural architectures either fail to capture long-range dependencies which are ubiquitous in programs, or cannot learn effective representations for syntax tree nodes, making them incapable of performing the node-level prediction tasks, e.g., bug localization. In this paper, we propose Tree-Transformer, a novel recursive tree-structured neural network to learn the vector representations for source codes. We propose a multi-head attention mechanism to model the dependency between siblings and parent-children node pairs. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional propagation strategy to allow node information passing in two directions, bottom-up and top-down along trees. In this way, Tree-Transformer can learn the information of the node features as well as the global contextual information.

Miao H.; Chen J.; Lin Y.; Xu M.; Han Y.; Gao J.,JG2Time: A Learned Time Estimator for Join Operators Based on Heterogeneous Join-Graphs,"The join operator is one of the key operators in RDBMS, and estimating its evaluation time is a fundamental task in query optimization, scheduling, etc. However, it is hard to make a precise estimation, which is not only related with the physical join implementations (hash, sort, loop) but also with the corresponding parameters, like the size of the data, the number of partitions, the number of threads in a modern hash join. Existing works rely on the time complexity analysis but yield rough results, or employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model but require many training instances. In this paper, we propose a method, named JG2Time, to estimate the running time using the join-graphs constructed from the source codes. Specifically, we construct a heterogonous join-graph by annotating parameter nodes to a call-graph generated by running time analysis tools, and propose ReGAT, a heterogonous graph neural network, to fully capture the edge weights (the number of function calls) in the join-graph.

Sukur N.; Milošević N.; Pracner D.; Budimac Z.,Automated program improvement with reinforcement learning and graph neural networks,"Automated software transformations and the process of automated program repair and improvement are an important aspect of modern software engineering practices. In this paper, we describe a system which uses a graph-based deep learning model that can be trained to automatically transform and improve computer programs. By operating on language-agnostic, universal graph-like structures easily extractable from source code files (abstract syntax trees), the deep learning agent learns which transformations should be effectively applied to various structures recognized in the source code in order to improve it. By defining a metric which we want to improve and introducing an optimization task—a reinforcement learning setting, an agent learns to automatically apply a chain of transformations to the program, drastically improving it. While similar program improvement processes exist, they exclusively use exhaustive search algorithms to try all the possible code transformations which is a long process susceptible to local optimum issues. Our solution aims to model and embed structural knowledge about the programs being transformed which greatly helps the agent to choose best possible code transformations to apply. Elements of the approach we present in this paper are further applicable not just to automatic software improvement tasks, but also to other code-related tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160861647&doi=10.1007%2fs00500-023-08559-1&partnerID=40&md5=8f31b665e0a0762d68a81c3d84e68699,Soft Computing,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Chen C.; Peng X.; Xing Z.; Sun J.; Wang X.; Zhao Y.; Zhao W.,Holistic Combination of Structural and Textual Code Information for Context Based API Recommendation,"Context based API recommendation is an important way to help developers find the needed APIs effectively and efficiently. For effective API recommendation, we need not only a joint view of both structural and textual code information, but also a holistic view of correlated API usage in control and data flow graph as a whole. Unfortunately, existing API recommendation methods exploit structural or textual code information separately. In this work, we propose a novel API recommendation approach called APIRec-CST (API Recommendation by Combining Structural and Textual code information). APIRec-CST is a deep learning model that combines the API usage with the text information in the source code based on an API Context Graph Network and a Code Token Network that simultaneously learn structural and textual features for API recommendation. We apply APIRec-CST to train a model for JDK library based on 1,914 open-source Java projects and evaluate the accuracy and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) of API recommendation with another 6 open-source projects. The results show that our approach achieves respectively a top-1, top-5, top-10 accuracy and MRR of 60.3, 81.5, 87.7 and 69.4 percent, and significantly outperforms an existing graph-based statistical approach and a tree-based deep learning approach for API recommendation. A further analysis shows that textual code information makes sense and improves the accuracy and MRR. The sensitivity analysis shows that the top-k accuracy and MRR of APIRec-CST are insensitive to the number of APIs to be recommended in a hole. We also conduct a user study in which two groups of students are asked to finish 6 programming tasks with or without our APIRec-CST plugin. The results show that APIRec-CST can help the students to finish the tasks faster and more accurately and the feedback on the usability is overwhelmingly positive. © 1976-2012 IEEE.",Article,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104636235&doi=10.1109%2fTSE.2021.3074309&partnerID=40&md5=673fd9afacf9ce76e19fed9b164bd0b9,IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Alon Y.; David C.,Using graph neural networks for program termination,"Termination analyses investigate the termination behavior of programs, intending to detect nontermination, which is known to cause a variety of program bugs (e.g. hanging programs, denial-of-service vulnerabilities). Beyond formal approaches, various attempts have been made to estimate the termination behavior of programs using neural networks. However, the majority of these approaches continue to rely on formal methods to provide strong soundness guarantees and consequently suffer from similar limitations. In this paper, we move away from formal methods and embrace the stochastic nature of machine learning models. Instead of aiming for rigorous guarantees that can be interpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a program's termination behavior and of the likely reason for nontermination (when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Compared to previous approaches using neural networks for program termination, we also take advantage of the graph representation of programs by employing Graph Neural Networks. To further assist programmers in understanding and debugging nontermination bugs, we adapt the notions of attention and semantic segmentation, previously used for other application domains, to programs. Overall, we designed and implemented classifiers for program termination based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, as well as a semantic segmentation Graph Neural Network that localizes AST nodes likely to cause nontermination. We also illustrated how the information provided by semantic segmentation can be combined with program slicing to further aid debugging.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143064932&doi=10.1145%2f3540250.3549095&partnerID=40&md5=9156908b690ba90af862a39222ba7ecb,ESEC/FSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 30th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Liu J.; Zeng J.; Wang X.; Ji K.; Liang Z.,TeLL: Log level suggestions via modeling multi-level code block information,"Developers insert logging statements into source code to monitor system execution, which forms the basis for software debugging and maintenance. For distinguishing diverse runtime information, each software log is assigned with a separate verbosity level (e.g., trace and error). However, choosing an appropriate verbosity level is a challenging and error-prone task due to the lack of specifications for log level usages. Prior solutions aim to suggest log levels based on the code block in which a logging statement resides (i.e., intra-block features). Such suggestions, however, do not consider information from surrounding blocks (i.e., inter-block features), which also plays an important role in revealing logging characteristics. To address this issue, we combine multiple levels of code block information (i.e., intra-block and inter-block features) into a joint graph structure called Flow of Abstract Syntax Tree (FAST). To explicitly exploit multi-level block features, we design a new neural architecture, Hierarchical Block Graph Network (HBGN), on the FAST. In particular, it leverages graph neural networks to encode both the intra-block and inter-block features into code block representations and guide log level suggestions. We implement a prototype system, TeLL, and evaluate its effectiveness on nine large-scale software systems. Experimental results showcase TeLL's advantage in predicting log levels over the state-of-the-art approaches.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136803982&doi=10.1145%2f3533767.3534379&partnerID=40&md5=2e89b0ce740145a39cccfbfc5c613c53,ISSTA 2022 - Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","","",""
Qian Y.; Zhang Y.; Wen Q.; Ye Y.; Zhang C.,Rep2Vec: Repository Embedding via Heterogeneous Graph Adversarial Contrastive Learning,"Driven by the exponential increase of software and the advent of the pull-based development system Git, a large amount of open-source software has emerged on various social coding platforms. GitHub, as the largest platform, not only attracts developers and researchers to contribute legitimate software and research-related source code but has also become a popular platform for an increasing number of cybercriminals to perform continuous cyberattacks. Hence, some tools have been developed to learn representations of repositories on GitHub for various related applications (e.g., malicious repository detection) recently. However, most of them merely focus on code content while ignoring the rich relational data among repositories. In addition, they usually require a mass of resources to obtain sufficient labeled data for model training while ignoring the usefully handy unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a novel model Rep2Vec which integrates the code content, the structural relations, and the unlabeled data to learn the repository representations. First, to comprehensively model the repository data, we build a repository heterogeneous graph (Rep-HG) which is encoded by a graph neural network. Afterwards, to fully exploit unlabeled data in Rep-HG, we introduce adversarial attacks to generate more challenging contrastive pairs for the contrastive learning module to train the encoder in node view and meta-path view simultaneously. To alleviate the workload of the encoder against attacks, we further design a dual-stream contrastive learning module that integrates contrastive learning on adversarial graph and original graph together. Finally, the pre-trained encoder is fine-tuned to the downstream task, and further enhanced by a knowledge distillation module. Extensive experiments on the collected dataset from GitHub demonstrate the effectiveness of Rep2Vec in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for multiple repository tasks.  © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137142998&doi=10.1145%2f3534678.3539324&partnerID=40&md5=c3c7c70d0cdcdb6b01b1b244a0b4d5a9,Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","","",""

However, how to find a suitable web service from existing repositories to meet requirements is still an open issue. Among others, web service classification is one of the most essential and effective means for web service recommendation. Previous studies have concerned this problem, but a critical issue, i.e., the semantic and syntactic information for the web service, is often ignored. To address such an issue, in this work, we propose Graph4Web, which uses a relation-aware graph attention network for web service classification. Specifically, we first parse the web service description sequence into the dependency graph and initialize the embedding vector of each node in the graph by tuning the pre-trained BERT model. We further propose a relation-aware graph attention layer to learn and update the node embedding vector by aggregating the information of neighborhood nodes and the distinct types of relationships between nodes. In addition, we introduce the self-attention mechanism to acquire the high-level global representation for web service classification.

It helps to recover, from source code, the developers' design decisions and trade-offs that could be not up-to-date or even not documented. Several approaches to mine design patterns from source code have been defined in the last twelve years and they are all based on the analysis of object-oriented systems components, their relationships, and behaviors to identify the roles played in the patterns. Both static and dynamic approaches need to perform matching between data captured from the system with the design patterns specification that encodes the structure and the behavior of the micro-architectural solution. The matching process, in principle, can be formulated as a sub-graph matching problem that is NP-complete. This problem has been addressed in the literature using heuristics designed to produce good solutions in an acceptable time, but the task is still expensive with a significant trade-off between accuracy and performance. This work proposes the adoption of a neural-based approach that exploits graph neural networks to perform detection using a more efficient sub-graph matching step outperforming existing heuristics proposed for this task. The pattern detection approach has been assessed on several open-source systems widely used to perform design pattern detection obtaining very good results for both detection performances and efficiency. © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130388510&doi=10.1145%2f3477314.3507073&partnerID=40&md5=b0ba92c528295442e80c974754fde807,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,

Meanwhile, advances in software repository maintenance have recently helped create very large datasets of source code. The result is fertile ground for Graph Neural Network representations of software to facilitate a plethora of software mining tasks.

Most recent works was mainly focused on complementing AST-based source code models by introducing contextual dependencies extracted from CFG. However, all of them pay little attention to the representation of basic blocks, which are the basis of contextual dependencies. In this paper, we integrated AST and CFG and proposed a novel source code model embedded with hierarchical dependencies. Based on that, we also designed a neural network that depends on the graph attention mechanism.

An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs' structures. MANDO extracts customized meta-paths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score. © 2022 IEEE.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143075291&doi=10.1109%2fDSAA54385.2022.10032337&partnerID=40&md5=a50173fabedbf7977331fc2f6d90f0d3,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 9th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2022",Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","","",""

Traditional methods like static and dynamic analysis have flaws like insufficient accuracy or high overhead runtime. Recent studies are more interested in applying machine learning techniques to this topic. The crux of parallelism discovery with machine learning is to generate meaningful code representations. One promising route is to exploit the dependence graph through Graph Neural Networks (GNNS). In this paper, a novel multi-view framework is proposed to automatically detect potential parallelism opportunities. Sequential programs are first repre-sented by program execution graphs encompassing both semantic and structural information. Then two independent views are defined: namely, a structural pattern view and a node feature view. In the structural view, local graph structural patterns are captured via random anonymous walks and then fed into a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The node features, both dynamic and static, are fed into another GCN in the node feature view. In addition, a multi-view model is designed to unify the node features and the structural features for parallelism detection.

Despite the success, existing works fail to take human behaviors as reference in understanding programs. In this paper, we consider human behaviors and propose the PGNN-EK model that consists of two main components.

On the other hand, to characterize human behaviors of resorting to other resources to help code comprehension, we transform raw codes with external knowledge and apply pre-training techniques for information extraction. Finally, we combine the two embeddings generated from the two components to output code embeddings.

Nguyen H.V.; Zheng J.; Inomata A.; Uehara T.,Code Aggregate Graph: Effective Representation for Graph Neural Networks to Detect Vulnerable Code,"Deep learning, especially graph neural networks (GNNs), provides efficient, fast, and automated methods to detect vulnerable code. However, the accuracy could be improved as previous studies were limited by existing code representations. Additionally, the diversity of embedding techniques and GNN models can make selecting the appropriate method challenging. Herein we propose Code Aggregate Graph (CAG) to improve vulnerability detection efficiency. CAG combines the principles of different code analyses such as abstract syntax tree, control flow graph, and program dependence graph with dominator and post-dominator trees. This extensive representation empowers deep graph networks for enhanced classification. We also implement different data encoding methods and neural networks to provide a multidimensional view of the system performance. Specifically, three word embedding approaches and three deep GNNs are utilized to build classifiers. Then CAG is evaluated using two datasets: a real-world open-source dataset and the software assurance reference dataset. CAG is also compared with seven state-of-the-art methods and six classic representations. CAG shows the best performance. Compared to previous studies, CAG has an increased accuracy (5.4%) and F1-score (5.1%). Additionally, experiments confirm that encoding has a positive impact on accuracy (4-6%) but the network type does not. The study should contribute to a meaningful benchmark for future research on code representations, data encoding, and GNNs.  © 2013 IEEE.",Article,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140708573&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2022.3216395&partnerID=40&md5=1a5ef9149269d7bcb295558d4263f64a,IEEE Access,Yes,Include,I1.2,"","",""

To improve the overall development efficiency, many API recommendation approaches have been proposed. However, they could not make good use of the information in the source code, especially for the structural information. The PDG (Program Dependence Graph) of source code can contain both syntactic and structural information, which can be great representations of the source code. Based on the PDG, we propose a new approach, called JARST (Java API Recommendation combining Structural with Textual code information), which recommends the appropriate APIs by analyzing the structure information and text information of the source code. The JARST approach uses a graph neural network to learn source code structure information of PDG and uses a multi-modal approach to learn the text information in the source code. Finally, we combine the structural and textual information of the source code to implement API recommendations. We collect 625 open source Java projects from Github as our experimental objects. The experimental results show that JARST can provide accurate APIs to help software developers facilitate development activities.

Paaßen B.; McBroom J.; Jeffries B.; Yacef K.; Koprinska I.,Mapping Python Programs to Vectors using Recursive Neural Encodings,"Educational data mining involves the application of data mining techniques to student activity. However, in the context of computer programming, many data mining techniques can not be applied because they require vector-shaped input, whereas computer programs have the form of syntax trees. In this paper, we present ast2vec, a neural network that maps Python syntax trees to vectors and back, thereby enabling about a hundred data mining techniques that were previously not applicable. Ast2vec has been trained on almost half a million programs of novice programmers and is designed to be applied across learning tasks without re-training, meaning that users can apply it without any need for deep learning. We demonstrate the generality of ast2vec in three settings. First, we provide example analyses using ast2vec on a classroom-sized dataset, involving two novel techniques, namely progress-variance projection for visualization and a dynamical systems analysis for prediction. In these examples, we also explain how ast2vec can be utilized for educational decisions. Second, we consider the ability of ast2vec to recover the original syntax tree from its vector representation on the training data and two other large-scale programming datasets. Finally, we evaluate the predictive capability of a linear dynamical system on top of ast2vec, obtaining similar results to techniques that work directly on syntax trees while being much faster (constant- instead of linear-time processing). We hope ast2vec can augment the educational data mining toolkit by making analyses of computer programs easier, richer, and more efficient. © 2021.

Ramadan T.; Islam T.Z.; Phelps C.; Pinnow N.; Thiagarajan J.J.,Comparative Code Structure Analysis using Deep Learning for Performance Prediction,"Performance analysis has always been an afterthought during the application development process, focusing on application correctness first. The learning curve of the existing static and dynamic analysis tools are steep, which requires understanding low-level details to interpret the findings for actionable optimizations. Additionally, application performance is a function of a number of unknowns stemming from the application-, runtime-, and interactions between the OS and underlying hardware, making it difficult to model using any deep learning technique, especially without a large labeled dataset. In this paper, we address both of these problems by presenting a large corpus of a labeled dataset for the community and take a comparative analysis approach to mitigate all unknowns except their source code differences between different correct implementations of the same problem. We put the power of deep learning to the test for automatically extracting information from the hierarchical structure of abstract syntax trees to represent source code. This paper aims to assess the feasibility of using purely static information (e.g., abstract syntax tree or AST) of applications to predict performance change based on the change in code structure. This research will enable performance-aware application development since every version of the application will continue to contribute to the corpora, which will enhance the performance of the model. We evaluate several deep learning-based representation learning techniques for source code. Our results show that tree-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models can leverage source code's hierarchical structure to discover latent representations.

Algorithm selection via machine learning (ML) has recently been successfully applied for various problem classes, including computationally hard problems such as SAT. In this paper, we study algorithm selection for software validation, i.e., the task of choosing a software validation tool for a given validation instance. A validation instance consists of a program plus properties to be checked on it. The application of machine learning techniques to this task first of all requires an appropriate representation of software. To this end,we propose a dedicated kernel function, which compares two programs in terms of their similarity, thus making the algorithm selection task amenable to kernel-based machine learning methods. Our kernel operates on a graph representation of source code mixing elements of control-flow and program-dependence graphs with abstract syntax trees.Thus, given two such representations as input, the kernel function yields a real-valued score that can be interpreted as a degree of similarity. We experimentally evaluate our kernel in two learning scenarios, namely a classification and a ranking problem: (1) selecting between a verification and a testing tool for bug finding (i.e., property violation), and (2) ranking several verification tools,from presumably best to worst, for property proving. The evaluation, which is based on data sets from the annual software verification competition SV-COMP, demonstrates our kernel to generalize well and to achieve rather high prediction accuracy, both for the classification and the ranking task. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083878337&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-020-00270-x&partnerID=40&md5=cf9df51fce68c365deb53d95201ca5b3,Automated Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.2,"",Include,

Wang Y.; Wang K.; Gao F.; Wang L.,Learning semantic program embeddings with graph interval neural network,"Learning distributed representations of source code has been a challenging task for machine learning models. Earlier works treated programs as text so that natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such approaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by source code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn embeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous (i.e. do not take advantage of the program-specific graph characteristics) and expensive (i.e. require heavy information exchange among nodes in the graph) message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues, especially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this paper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural Network (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained through an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular, GINN focuses exclusively on intervals (generally manifested in looping construct) for mining the feature representation of a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs. We evaluate GINN for two popular downstream applications: variable misuse prediction and method name prediction. Results show in both cases GINN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a comfortable margin. We have also created a neural bug detector based on GINN to catch null pointer deference bugs in Java code. While learning from the same 9,000 methods extracted from 64 projects, GINN-based bug detector significantly outperforms GNN-based bug detector on 13 unseen test projects. Next, we deploy our trained GINN-based bug detector and Facebook Infer, arguably the state-of-the-art static analysis tool, to scan the codebase of 20 highly starred projects on GitHub. Through our manual inspection, we confirm 38 bugs out of 102 warnings raised by GINN-based bug detector compared to 34 bugs out of 129 warnings for Facebook Infer.

However, compared with natural language, code has more obvious repetition characteristics. For example, a variable can be used many times in the following code. Variables in source code have a high chance to be repetitive. Cloned code and templates, also have the property of token repetition. Capturing the token repetition of source code is important. In different projects, variables or types are usually named differently. This means that a model trained in a finite data set will encounter a lot of unseen variables or types in another data set. How to model the semantics of the unseen data and how to predict the unseen data based on the patterns of token repetition are two challenges in code completion. Hence, in this paper, token repetition is modelled as a graph, we propose a novel REP model which is based on deep neural graph network to learn the code toke repetition. The REP model is to identify the edge connections of a graph to recognize the token repetition. For predicting the token repetition of token n, the information of all the previous tokens needs to be considered. We use memory neural network (MNN) to model the semantics of each distinct token to make the framework of REP model more targeted. The experiments indicate that the REP model performs better than LSTM model. Compared with Attention-Pointer network, we also discover that the attention mechanism does not work in all situations. The proposed REP model could achieve similar or slightly better prediction accuracy compared to Attention-Pointer network and consume less training time.

Wei J.; Goyal M.; Durrett G.; Dillig I.,LAMBDANET: PROBABILISTIC TYPE INFERENCE USING GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS,"As gradual typing becomes increasingly popular in languages like Python and TypeScript, there is a growing need to infer type annotations automatically. While type annotations help with tasks like code completion and static error catching, these annotations cannot be fully determined by compilers and are tedious to annotate by hand. This paper proposes a probabilistic type inference scheme for TypeScript based on a graph neural network. Our approach first uses lightweight source code analysis to generate a program abstraction called a type dependency graph, which links type variables with logical constraints as well as name and usage information. Given this program abstraction, we then use a graph neural network to propagate information between related type variables and eventually make type predictions. Our neural architecture can predict both standard types, like number or string, as well as user-defined types that have not been encountered during training.

Chirila C.-B.; Sora I.,The Optimization of a Page Rank Based Key Classes Classifier using Simulated Annealing with ROC-AUC and Recall Metrics,"Nowadays, software projects from different industrial sectors tend to grow from tens of classes towards sizes of hundreds or even thousands of classes. Key classes or hotspots are the most important classes in a project. They represent the starting point for any maintenance operation. In this context key classes detection is an important software engineering task, especially in projects where documentation is poor or missing totally. In the state of the art there are several key classes classifiers based on different representations and algorithms. We focus on the empirical parameters of a classifier based on weighted graph representation of the source code combined with a Page Rank algorithm which give the best results compared to previous works results available online. The empirical parameters represent weights assigned to several relations between classes like: inheritance between two classes, interface implementation between a class and an interface etc. Initially the parameters were manually set, having empirical values. It is not known if other sets of values for the parameters will not give better diagnostic abilities to the classifier. To test the entire parameters state space is virtually impossible for 12 Java software projects and 15 parameters with values varying in the integer range. Using the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm we start with the manually set values for the parameters and we optimize the objective functions based on ROC-AUC and Recall metrics. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference paper,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075065323&doi=10.1109%2fSACI46893.2019.9111601&partnerID=40&md5=1156fad3845e01b6654b7b6870f54408,"SACI 2019 - IEEE 13th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics, Proceedings",Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Gutiérrez-Cárdenas J.; Quintana-Cruz H.; Mego-Fernandez D.; Diaz-Baskakov S.,Heuristics applied to mutation testing in an impure functional programming language,"The task of elaborating accurate test suites for program testing can be an extensive computational work. Mutation testing is not immune to the problem of being a computational and time-consuming task so that it has found relief in the use of heuristic techniques. The use of Genetic Algorithms in mutation testing has proved to be useful for probing test suites, but it has mainly been enclosed only in the field of imperative programming paradigms. Therefore, we decided to test the feasibility of using Genetic Algorithms for performing mutation testing in functional programming environments. We tested our proposal by making a graph representations of four different functional programs and applied a Genetic Algorithm to generate a population of mutant programs. We found that it is possible to obtain a set of mutants that could find flaws in test suites in functional programming languages. Additionally, we encountered that when a source code increases its number of instructions it was simpler for a genetic algorithm to find a mutant that can avoid all of the test cases. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.",Article,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070527479&doi=10.14569%2fijacsa.2019.0100670&partnerID=40&md5=75493f304015a8f92c08cf2534f7e761,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,Yes,Exclude,E2.2,"","",""

In contrast to natural languages, programming languages usually have a well-defined structure. With this structure compilers can reason about programs, using graphs such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) or control-data flow graphs (CDFGs). In this paper, we argue that we should use these graph structures instead of sequences for learning compiler optimization tasks. To this end, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) for learning predictive compiler tasks on two representations based on ASTs and CDFGs. Experiments show that this improves upon the state-of-the-art in the task of heterogeneous OpenCL mapping, while providing orders of magnitude faster inference times, crucial for compiler optimizations. When testing on benchmark suites not included for training, our AST-based model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by over 12 percentage points in terms of accuracy. It is the only one to perform clearly better than a random mapping.

Zhou B.; Xia X.; Lo D.; Wang X.,Build predictor: More accurate missed dependency prediction in build configuration files,"Software build system (e.g., Make) plays an important role in compiling human-readable source code into an executable program. One feature of build system such as make-based system is that it would use a build configuration file (e.g., Make file) to record the dependencies among different target and source code files. However, sometimes important dependencies would be missed in a build configuration file, which would cause additional debugging effort to fix it. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Build Predictor to mine the missed dependncies. We first analyze dependencies in a build configuration file (e.g., Make file), and establish a dependency graph which captures various dependencies in the build configuration file. Next, considering that a build configuration file is constructed based on the source code dependency relationship, we establish a code dependency graph (code graph). Build Predictor is a composite model, which combines both dependency graph and code graph, to achieve a high prediction performance. We collected 7 build configuration files from various open source projects, which are Zlib, putty, vim, Apache Portable Runtime (APR), memcached, nginx, and Tengine, to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network-based method for Developer Recommendation (called HGDR), in which text information embedding and self-supervised learning (SSL) are incorporated. Specifically, to alleviate the sparsity of developer-issue interactions, we unify developer-issue interactions, developer-source code file interactions and issue-source code file relations into a heterogeneous graph, and we embed text descriptions to graph nodes as information supplements. In addition, to mitigate the long-tail influence, e.g., recommendation bias, the proficiency weight suppression link supplementation is proposed to complement the tail developers by adjusting proficiency weights. Finally, to fully utilize rich structural information of heterogeneous graph, we use the joint learning of metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network and SSL to learn the embedding representation. Extensive comparison experiments on three real-world datasets show that HGDR outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 6.02% to 44.27% on recommended metric.

Krasanakis E.; Symeonidis A.,Fast Library Recommendation in Software Dependency Graphs with Symmetric Partially Absorbing Random Walks,"To help developers discover libraries suited to their software projects, automated approaches often start from already employed libraries and recommend more based on co-occurrence patterns in other projects. The most accurate project–library recommendation systems employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that learn latent node representations for link prediction. However, GNNs need to be retrained when dependency graphs are updated, for example, to recommend libraries for new projects, and are thus unwieldy for scalable deployment. To avoid retraining, we pro-pose that recommendations can instead be performed with graph filters; by analyzing dependency graph dynamics emulating human-driven library discovery, we identify low-pass filtering with memory as a promising direction and introduce a novel filter, called symmetric partially absorbing random walks, which infers rather than trains the parameters of filters with node-specific memory to guarantee low-pass filtering. Experiments on a dependency graph between Android projects and third-party libraries show that our approach makes recommendations with a quality and diversifica-tion loosely comparable to those state-of-the-art GNNs without computationally intensive retraining for new predictions. © 2022 by the authors.

To improve the usability of these tools, researchers have recently begun to apply machine learning techniques to classify and filter incorrect analysis reports. Although initial results have been promising, the long-term potential and best practices for this line of research are unclear due to the lack of detailed, large-scale empirical evaluation. To partially address this knowledge gap, we present a comparative empirical study of three machine learning techniques—traditional models, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and graph neural networks (GNNs)—for classifying correct and incorrect results in three static analysis tools—FindSecBugs, CBMC, and JBMC—using multiple datasets. These tools represent different techniques of static analysis, namely taint analysis and model-checking. We also introduce and evaluate new data preparation routines for RNNs and node representations for GNNs. We find that overall classification accuracy reaches a high of 80%–99% for different datasets and application scenarios. We observe that data preparation routines have a positive impact on classification accuracy, with an improvement of up to 5% for RNNs and 16% for GNNs. Overall, our results suggest that neural networks (RNNs or GNNs) that learn over a program’s source code outperform traditional models, although interesting tradeoffs are present among all techniques.

Tommasel A.; Diaz-Pace J.A.,Identifying emerging smells in software designs based on predicting package dependencies,"Software systems naturally evolve, and this evolution often brings design problems that contribute to system degradation. Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among packages. The early detection of smells is essential for software engineers to plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts. Although tools for identifying smells exist, they detect the smells once they already exist in the source code when their undesired dependencies are already created. In this work, we explore a forward-looking approach for identifying smells that can emerge in the next system version based on inferring package dependencies that are likely to appear in the system. Our approach takes the current design structure of the system as a network, along with information from previous versions, and applies link prediction techniques from the field of social network analysis. In particular, we consider a group of smells known as instability smells (cyclic dependency, hub-like dependency, and unstable dependency), which fit well with the link prediction model. The approach includes a feedback mechanism to progressively reduce false positives in predictions. An evaluation based on six open-source projects showed that, under certain considerations, the proposed approach can satisfactorily predict missing dependencies and smell configurations thereof. The feedback mechanism led to improvements of up to three times the initial precision values.

Lin G.; Zhang J.; Luo W.; Pan L.; Xiang Y.; De Vel O.; Montague P.,Cross-Project Transfer Representation Learning for Vulnerable Function Discovery,"Machine learning is now widely used to detect security vulnerabilities in the software, even before the software is released. But its potential is often severely compromised at the early stage of a software project when we face a shortage of high-quality training data and have to rely on overly generic hand-crafted features. This paper addresses this cold-start problem of machine learning, by learning rich features that generalize across similar projects. To reach an optimal balance between feature-richness and generalizability, we devise a data-driven method including the following innovative ideas. First, the code semantics are revealed through serialized abstract syntax trees (ASTs), with tokens encoded by Continuous Bag-of-Words neural embeddings. Next, the serialized ASTs are fed to a sequential deep learning classifier (Bi-LSTM) to obtain a representation indicative of software vulnerability. Finally, the neural representation obtained from existing software projects is then transferred to the new project to enable early vulnerability detection even with a small set of training labels. To validate this vulnerability detection approach, we manually labeled 457 vulnerable functions and collected 30 000+ nonvulnerable functions from six open-source projects. The empirical results confirmed that the trained model is capable of generating representations that are indicative of program vulnerability and is adaptable across multiple projects.

To improve the usability of these tools, researchers have recently begun to apply machine learning techniques to classify and filter false positive analysis reports. Although initial results have been promising, the long-term potential and best practices for this line of research are unclear due to the lack of detailed, large-scale empirical evaluation. To partially address this knowledge gap, we present a comparative empirical study of four machine learning techniques, namely hand-engineered features, bag of words, recurrent neural networks, and graph neural networks, for classifying false positives, using multiple ground-truth program sets. We also introduce and evaluate new data preparation routines for recurrent neural networks and node representations for graph neural networks, and show that these routines can have a substantial positive impact on classification accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that recurrent neural networks (which learn over a program's source code) outperform the other subject techniques, although interesting tradeoffs are present among all techniques.

Li Y.; Wang S.; Nguyen T.N.; Van Nguyen S.,Improving bug detection via context-based code representation learning and attention-based neural networks,"Bug detection has been shown to be an effective way to help developers in detecting bugs early, thus, saving much effort and time in software development process. Recently, deep learning-based bug detection approaches have gained successes over the traditional machine learning-based approaches, the rule-based program analysis approaches, and mining-based approaches. However, they are still limited in detecting bugs that involve multiple methods and suffer high rate of false positives. In this paper, we propose a combination approach with the use of contexts and attention neural network to overcome those limitations. We propose to use as the global context the Program Dependence Graph (PDG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG) to connect the method under investigation with the other relevant methods that might contribute to the buggy code. The global context is complemented by the local context extracted from the path on the AST built from the method's body. The use of PDG and DFG enables our model to reduce the false positive rate, while to complement for the potential reduction in recall, we make use of the attention neural network mechanism to put more weights on the buggy paths in the source code. That is, the paths that are similar to the buggy paths will be ranked higher, thus, improving the recall of our model. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate our approach on a very large dataset with +4.973M methods in 92 different project versions. The results show that our tool can have a relative improvement up to 160% on F-score when comparing with the state-of-the-art bug detection approaches. Our tool can detect 48 true bugs in the list of top 100 reported bugs, which is 24 more true bugs when comparing with the baseline approaches. We also reported that our representation is better suitable for bug detection and relatively improves over the other representations up to 206% in accuracy. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Diaz-Pace J.A.; Tommasel A.; Godoy D.,Towards anticipation of architectural smells using link prediction techniques,"Software systems naturally evolve, and this evolution often brings design problems that cause system degradation. Architectural smells are typical symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important for developers, because they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Existing tools for identifying architectural smells can detect the smells once they exist in the source code. This means that their undesired dependencies are already created. In this work, we explore a forward-looking approach that is able to infer groups of likely module dependencies that can anticipate architectural smells in a future system version. Our approach considers the current module structure as a network, along with information from previous versions, and applies link prediction techniques (from the field of social network analysis). In particular, we focus on dependency-related smells, such as Cyclic Dependency and Hub-like Dependency, which fit well with the link prediction model. An initial evaluation with two open-source projects shows that, under certain considerations, the predictions of our approach are satisfactory. Furthermore, the approach can be extended to other types of dependency-based smells or metrics. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference paper,2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058275146&doi=10.1109%2fSCAM.2018.00015&partnerID=40&md5=735f0c987e0c433b10f67a72f9f2a97b,"Proceedings - 18th IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation, SCAM 2018",Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

It assists the subsequent steps of the refactoring process so as to improve the quality of the software system. However, most of existing approaches have been limited to the use of structural information. There have been few researches to detect code smells using semantic information although its proven effectiveness in many software engineering problems. In addition, they do not capture entirely the semantic embedded in the source code. This paper attempts to fill this gap by proposing a semantic-based approach that detects bad smells which are scattered at different levels of granularity in the source code.

Zhang C.; Xin Y.,VulGAI: vulnerability detection based on graphs and images,"Deep learning models have been widely used in the field of vulnerability detection. Deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods can automatically learn code patterns. Some methods consider processing codes as text sequences to achieve scalable vulnerability detection. They leverage natural language processing models to extract code features. These methods do not consider the code's semantic structure and treat code slices as text. Vulnerability detection methods based on graph structures and graph neural networks are more accurate than text-based methods. However, these methods lack scalability in practice. Both graph generation and graph neural network training are all time-consuming. We propose a vulnerability detection method based on graphs and images (VulGAI). VulGAI choose the more reasonable node centrality to generate the image. It can preserve program details and distinguish node importance from different perspectives. In addition, we design a more efficient CNN model, which reduces computational overhead and improves detection performance (Time and Accuracy). We implement VulGAI and evaluate six methods (VulDePecker, SySeVR, Devign, VulCNN, mVulPreter, and VulGAI) on 40,657 functions. Experimental results show that VulGAI achieves higher Accuracy, TPR, and F1-Score than the others. In addition, we compare VulGAI and VulCNN on 30270 real-world functions.

Thus automatic vulnerability detection methods based on code representation graph and Graph Neural Network (GNN) have been proposed with the advantage of effectively capture both the semantics and structure information of the source code, showing a better performance. However, these methods ignore the redundant information in the graph and the GNN model, leading to a still unsatisfactory performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a attention-based automatic vulnerability detection approach with Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network (GGNN). Firstly, we introduce two preprocessing methods namely pruning and symbolization representation to reduce the redundant information of the input code representation graph, and then put the graph into the GGNN layer to update the node features. Next, the key subgraph extraction and global feature aggregation are realized through the attention-based Pooling layers. Finally, the classification result is obtained through a linear classifier.

Qian J.; Ju X.; Chen X.,GNet4FL: effective fault localization via graph convolutional neural network,"Fault localization aims to efficiently locate faults when debugging programs, reducing software development and maintenance costs. Spectrum-based fault location (SBFL) is the most commonly used fault location technology, which calculates and ranks the suspicious value of each program entity with a specific formula by counting the coverage information of all the program entities and execution results of test cases. However, previous SBFL techniques suffered from low accuracy due to the sole use of execution coverage. This paper proposed an approach GNet4FL based on the graph convolutional neural network. GNet4FL first collects static features based on code structure and dynamic features based on test results. Then, GNet4FL uses GraphSAGE to obtain node representation of source codes and performs feature fusion on an entity consisting of multiple nodes, which preserves the topological information of the graph. Finally, the representation of each entity is input to the multi-layer perceptron for training and ranking entities. The results of the study showed that GNet4FL successfully located 160 out of 262 faults, outperforming the three state-of-the-art methods by 94, 42, and 14% in Top-1 accuracy, and having close results to Grace with less cost.

Tang M.; Tang W.; Gui Q.; Hu J.; Zhao M.,A vulnerability detection algorithm based on residual graph attention networks for source code imbalance (RGAN),"It is essential to detect potential vulnerabilities in software to ensure its safety. As software systems become more complex, traditional static vulnerability detection methods perform poorly. Currently, deep learning-based vulnerability detection models only extract source code vulnerability features using sequences or graphs. Sequential neural networks ignore structural information in the code, such as control flow diagrams and data flow diagrams. Additionally, graph neural networks cannot accurately extract features due to the lack of effective methods for extracting nodes’ features and aggregating global information. To address the above issue, we propose a vulnerability detection algorithm based on residual graph attention networks for source code imbalance (RGAN). Firstly, a local feature extraction module (PE-BL-A module) is designed. Using the sequence neural network, the module extracts various useful features, including node features in a control flow diagram based on local semantic features.

To learn and update node features along the control flow direction, the module uses a graph attention network with residual connections. In this module, a mean biaffine attention pooling mechanism is proposed that can extract total graph vulnerability features more effectively.

To automate detection and reduce labor costs, many deep learning-based methods have been proposed. However, these approaches have been found to be either ineffective in detecting multiple classes of vulnerabilities or limited by treating original source code as a natural language sequence without exploiting the structural information of code. In this paper, we propose VDoTR, a model that leverages a new tensor representation of comprehensive code graphs, including AST, CFG, DFG, and NCS, to detect multiple types of vulnerabilities. Firstly, a tensor structure is introduced to represent the structured information of code, which deeply captures code features. Secondly, a new Circle Gated Graph Neural Network (CircleGGNN) is designed based on tensor for hidden state embedding of nodes. CircleGGNN can perform heterogeneous graph information fusion more directly and effectively. Lastly, a 1-D convolution-based output layer is applied to hidden embedding features for classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the detection performance of VDoTR is superior to other approaches with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure on multiple datasets for vulnerability detection.

Deep learning is an emerging approach for vulnerability detection tasks. Existing deep learning-based code vulnerability detection methods are usually based on word2vec embedding of linear sequences of source code, followed by code vulnerability detection through RNNs network. However, such methods can only capture the superficial structural or syntactic information of the source code text, which is not suitable for modeling the complex control flow and data flow and miss edge information in the graph structure constructed by the source code, with limited effect of neural network model. To solve the above problems, this article proposes a code vulnerability detection method, named VulGraB, which is based on graph embedding and bidirectional gated graph neural networks. VulGraB uses node2vec to convert the program-dependent graphs into graph embeddings of the code, which contain rich structure information of the source code, improving the ability of features to express nonlinear information to a certain extent. Then the BiGGNN is used for training, and finally the accuracy of the detection results is evaluated using target program. The bi-directional gated neural network utilizes a bi-directional recurrent structure, which is beneficial to global information aggregation. The experimental results show that the accuracy of VulGraB is significantly improved over the baseline models on two datasets, with F1 scores of 85.89% and 97.24% being the highest, demonstrating that VulGraB consistently outperforms other effective vulnerability detection models. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152473653&doi=10.1002%2fspe.3205&partnerID=40&md5=d2796319b2e3f7249116999d618965af,Software - Practice and Experience,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,

Şahin C.B.,Semantic-based vulnerability detection by functional connectivity of gated graph sequence neural networks,"In computer security, semantic learning is helpful in understanding vulnerability requirements, realizing source code semantics, and constructing vulnerability knowledge. Nevertheless, learning how to extract and select the most valuable features for software vulnerability detection remains difficult. In this paper, we first derive a subset of vulnerability knowledge representations from the Functional Connectivity (FC) of Graph Gated Sequence Neural Networks (GGNNs). The Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks can be utilized to capture the long-term dependency to understand a high-level representation of potential vulnerabilities in order to detect vulnerabilities on a target project. Studying functional connectivity-based Graph Neural Networks ensures our deep understanding of the operation of sequence graph networks as highly complex interconnected systems. This ensures that the model focuses on vulnerability-related code, which makes it more appropriate for vulnerability mining tasks. Which constructs a composite semantic code property graph for code representation based on the causes of vulnerabilities. The experimental findings indicate that the suggested Model can select relevant discriminative features and achieve superior performance than benchmark methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145500304&doi=10.1007%2fs00500-022-07777-3&partnerID=40&md5=df0914786b4bd21b14ee00081fc4155e,Soft Computing,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Wang M.; Tao C.; Guo H.,LCVD: Loop-oriented code vulnerability detection via graph neural network,"Due to the unique mechanism and complex structure, loops in programs can easily lead to various vulnerabilities such as dead loops, memory leaks, resource depletion, etc. Traditional approaches to loop-oriented program analysis (e.g. loop summarization) are costly with a high rate of false positives in complex software systems. To address the issues above, recent works have applied deep learning (DL) techniques to vulnerability detection. However, existing DL-based approaches mainly focused on the general characteristics of most vulnerabilities without considering the semantic information of specific vulnerabilities. As a typical structure in programs, loops are highly iterative with multi-paths. Currently, there is a lack of available approaches to represent loops, as well as useful methods to extract the implicit vulnerability patterns. Therefore, this paper introduces LCVD, an automated loop-oriented code vulnerability detection approach. LCVD represents the source code as the Loop-flow Abstract Syntax Tree (LFAST), which focuses on interleaving multi-paths around loop structures. Then a novel Loop-flow Graph Neural Network (LFGNN) is proposed to learn both the local and overall structure of loop-oriented vulnerabilities.

Tang W.; Tang M.; Ban M.; Zhao Z.; Feng M.,CSGVD: A deep learning approach combining sequence and graph embedding for source code vulnerability detection,"In order to secure software, it is critical to detect potential vulnerabilities. The performance of traditional static vulnerability detection methods is limited by predefined rules, which rely heavily on the expertise of developers. Existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection models usually use only a single sequence or graph embedding approach to extract vulnerability features. Sequence embedding-based models ignore the structured information inherent in the code, and graph embedding-based models lack effective node and graph embedding methods. As a result, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach, CSGVD (Combining Sequence and Graph embedding for Vulnerability Detection), which considers function-level vulnerability detection as a graph binary classification task. Firstly, we propose a PE-BL module, which inherits and enhances the knowledge from the pre-trained language model. It extracts the code's local semantic features as node embedding in the control flow graph by using sequence embedding. Secondly, CSGVD uses graph neural networks to extract the structured information of the graph. Finally, we propose a mean biaffine attention pooling, M-BFA, to better aggregate node information as a graph's feature representation.

Nguyen S.; Vu T.T.; Vo H.D.,VFFINDER: A Graph-Based Approach for Automated Silent Vulnerability-Fix Identification,"The increasing reliance of software projects on third-party libraries has raised concerns about the security of these libraries due to hidden vulnerabilities. Managing these vul-nerabilities is challenging due to the time gap between fixes and public disclosures. Moreover, a significant portion of open-source projects silently fix vulnerabilities without disclosure, impacting vulnerability management. Existing tools like OWASP heavily rely on public disclosures, hindering their effectiveness in detecting unknown vulnerabilities. To tackle this problem, automated identification of vulnerability-fixing commits has emerged. However, identifying silent vulnerability fixes remains challenging. This paper presents VFFINDER, a novel graph-based approach for automated silent vulnerability fix identification. VFFINDER captures structural changes using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and represents them in annotated ASTs. VFFINDER distinguishes vulnerability-fixing commits from non-fixing ones using attention-based graph neural network models to extract structural features. We conducted experiments to evaluate VFFINDER on a dataset of 36K+ fixing and non-fixing commits in 507 real-world C/C++ projects. Our results show that VFFINDER significantly improves the state-of-the-art methods by 39-83% in Precision, 19-148% in Recall, and 30%-109% in F1. Especially, VFFINDER speeds up the silent fix identification process by up to 47% with the same review effort of 5% compared to the existing approaches.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173098270&doi=10.1109%2fKSE59128.2023.10299438&partnerID=40&md5=32132664d3df53b29a7ef7891aaaeca6,"Proceedings - International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering, KSE",Yes,Include,I1.2,"","",""
Wen X.-C.; Wang X.; Gao C.; Wang S.; Liu Y.; Gu Z.,When Less is Enough: Positive and Unlabeled Learning Model for Vulnerability Detection,"Automated code vulnerability detection has gained increasing attention in recent years. The deep learning (DL)-based methods, which implicitly learn vulnerable code patterns, have proven effective in vulnerability detection. The performance of DL-based methods usually relies on the quantity and quality of labeled data. However, the current labeled data are generally automatically collected, such as crawled from human-generated commits, making it hard to ensure the quality of the labels. Prior studies have demonstrated that the non-vulnerable code (i.e., negative labels) tends to be unreliable in commonly-used datasets, while vulnerable code (i.e., positive labels) is more determined. Considering the large numbers of unlabeled data in practice, it is necessary and worth exploring to leverage the positive data and large numbers of unlabeled data for more accurate vulnerability detection. In this paper, we focus on the Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning problem for vulnerability detection and propose a novel model named PILOT, i.e., Positive and unlabeled Learning mOdel for vulnerability deTection. PILOT only learns from positive and unlabeled data for vulnerability detection. It mainly contains two modules: (1) A distance-aware label selection module, aiming at generating pseudo-labels for selected unlabeled data, which involves the inter-class distance prototype and progressive fine-tuning; (2) A mixed-supervision representation learning module to further alleviate the influence of noise and enhance the discrimination of representations. Extensive experiments in vulnerability detection are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of PILOT based on real-world vulnerability datasets. The experimental results show that PILOT outperforms the popular weakly supervised methods by 2.78%-18.93% in the PU learning setting. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, PILOT also improves the performance of 1.34%-12.46 % in F1 score metrics in the supervised setting. In addition, PILOT can identify 23 mislabeled from the FFMPeg+Qemu dataset in the PU learning setting based on manual checking.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179004291&doi=10.1109%2fASE56229.2023.00144&partnerID=40&md5=014eb4c9c30ff19b855d8b63cbfe320b,"Proceedings - 2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2023",Yes,Exclude,E1.1,"","",""
Yang J.; Ruan O.; Zhang J.,Tensor-based gated graph neural network for automatic vulnerability detection in source code,"The rapid expansion of smart devices leads to the increasing demand for vulnerability detection in the cyber security field. Writing secure source codes is crucial to protect applications and software. Recent vulnerability detection methods are mainly using machine learning and deep learning. However, there are still some challenges, how to learn accurate source code semantic embedding at the function level, how to effectively perform vulnerability detection using the learned semantic embedding of source code and how to solve the overfitting problem of learning-based models. In this paper, we consider codes as various graphs with node features and propose a tensor-based gated graph neural network called TensorGNN to produce code embedding for function-level vulnerability detection. First, we propose a high-dimensional tensor for combining different code graph representations. Second, inspired by the work of tensor technology, we propose the TensorGNN model to produce accurate code representations using the graph tensor. We evaluate our model on 7 C and C++ large open-source code corpus (e.g. SARD&NVD, Debian, SATE IV, FFmpeg, libpng&LibTiff, Wireshark and Github datasets), which contains 13 types of vulnerabilities. Our TensorGNN model improves on existing state-of-the-art works by 10%–30% on average in terms of vulnerability detection accuracy and F1, while our TensorGNN model needs less training time and model parameters. Specifically, compared with other existing works, our model reduces 25–47 times of the number of parameters and decreases 3–10 times of training time.

Cheng X.,Vulnerability Detection via Typestate-Guided Code Representation Learning,"Machine learning, including deep learning, has found success in various domains. Recently, the focus has shifted to using deep learning, like graph neural networks, for static vulnerability detection. Existing methods represent code as an embedding vector and train models on safe and vulnerable code patterns to predict vulnerabilities. However, these models lack precise bug detection, as they prioritize coarse-grained classification over understanding vulnerability semantics, such as typestate properties. This paper introduces an innovative typestate-guided code embedding technique for accurate static vulnerability detection. We select and retain feasible typestate sequences extracted from typestate analysis using self-supervised contrastive learning in a pretrained path embedding model. This reduces the need for labeled data in training downstream models for vulnerability detection.

Fernaldy K.; Wardhana Asnar Y.D.,Detecting Command Injection and Cross-site Scripting Vulnerabilities Using Graph Representations,"Web-based applications, such as JavaScript-based applications, have vastly grown in scope and features. As web-based applications grow, the potential of vulnerabilities emerging inside such applications also grows. One of the ways to detect vulnerabilities inside web-based applications is to perform a static code analysis. Several static code analysis tools have been developed and are able to detect vulnerabilities inside JavaScript-based applications. However, these tools use abstract syntax tree representations in their analysis, therefore the analysis can't be performed efficiently. This paper proposes a static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities inside JavaScript-based applications using data-flow graph, control-flow graph, and call graph representations. Using taint analysis, a static code analysis tool is able to detect vulnerabilities in the form of command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Li X.; Xin Y.; Zhu H.; Yang Y.; Chen Y.,Cross-domain vulnerability detection using graph embedding and domain adaptation,"Vulnerability detection is an effective means to maintain cyberspace security. Machine learning methods have risen much attention in software security due to their advantage of accuracy and automation. However, current researches mainly focus on in-domain vulnerability detection where the training data and test data belong to the same domain. Due to application scenarios, coding habits, and other factors, vulnerabilities in different software projects may obey different probability distributions. This discrepancy compromises the performance of machine learning methods when they are applied to a brand-new project. To address this cold start problem, we propose a cross-domain vulnerability detection framework using graph embedding and deep domain adaption (VulGDA). It works in a variety of cross-domain fashions, including the Zero-Shot fashion that no labeled data in the target domain is available for training. VulGDA is decomposed to graph embedding and domain adaptation. At the graph embedding stage, we transform the samples in source code into graph representations where elements are directly concatenated according to their syntactic and semantic relationships. Then, we aggregate information from neighbors and edges defined in the graph into real-valued vectors. By graph embedding, VulGDA extracts comprehensive vulnerability features and compromises the challenge of long-term dependency. Aiming at the discrepancy between training data and test data, domain adaption is used to train a feature generator. This feature generator maps the graph embedding to a “deep” feature that is discriminative for vulnerability detection, and invariant to the shift between domains. We perform a systematic experiment to validate the effectiveness of VulGDA. The results show that combining graph embedding and deep domain adaptation promotes VulGDA's performance in cross-domain vulnerability detection. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method has better performance under the cold start condition. © 2022",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145617321&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2022.103017&partnerID=40&md5=15b2ba79fa4afd2aa82af96a915df12e,Computers and Security,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1,2","",Include,
Ni C.; Guo X.; Zhu Y.; Xu X.; Yang X.,Function-Level Vulnerability Detection Through Fusing Multi-Modal Knowledge,"Software vulnerabilities damage the functionality of software systems. Recently, many deep learning-based approaches have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities at the function level by using one or a few different modalities (e.g., text representation, graph-based representation) of the function and have achieved promising performance. However, some of these existing studies have not completely leveraged these diverse modalities, particularly the underutilized image modality, and the others using images to represent functions for vulnerability detection have not made adequate use of the significant graph structure underlying the images. In this paper, we propose MVulD, a multi-modal-based function-level vulnerability detection approach, which utilizes multi-modal features of the function (i.e., text representation, graph representation, and image representation) to detect vulnerabilities. Specifically, MVulD utilizes a pre-trained model (i.e., UniXcoder) to learn the semantic information of the textual source code, employs the graph neural network to distill graph-based representation, and makes use of computer vision techniques to obtain the image representation while retaining the graph structure of the function. We conducted a large-scale experiment on 25,816 functions. The experimental results show that MVulD improves four state-of-the-art baselines by 30.8%-81.3%, 12.8%-27.4%, 48.8%-115%, and 22.9%-141% in terms of F1-score, Accuracy, Precision, and PR-AUC respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179002505&doi=10.1109%2fASE56229.2023.00084&partnerID=40&md5=c4ca6b4d197b1c4cef905dbb95bbf33d,"Proceedings - 2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2023",Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1,2,I2.1","","",""

Although, deep learning has shown promise in this task, current state-of-the-art methods cannot classify and identify the line on which the vulnerability occurs. Instead, the developer is tasked with searching for an arbitrary bug in an entire function or even larger region of code. In this paper, we propose VulChecker: a tool that can precisely locate vulnerabilities in source code (down to the exact instruction) as well as classify their type (CWE). To accomplish this, we propose a new program representation, program slicing strategy, and the use of a message-passing graph neural network to utilize all of code's semantics and improve the reach between a vulnerability's root cause and manifestation points. We also propose a novel data augmentation strategy for cheaply creating strong datasets for vulnerability detection in the wild, using free synthetic samples available online.With this training strategy,VulCheckerwas able to identify 24 CVEs (10 from 2019&2020) in 19 projects taken from the wild, with nearly zero false positives compared to a commercial tool that could only detect 4.

Deep learning can automatically learn the features of code and is widely used in source code vulnerability detection. Some studies treat codes as text sequences, ignoring the structural relationship between lines of code. Other studies extract the code as a graph structure, but ignore the order relationship of code lines and do not make full use of the dependencies between code lines. This paper proposes a C/C++ source code vulnerability detection scheme based on SAT (Structure-Aware Transformer) structure. It first standardizes the source code, then extracts the PDG (program dependency graph) representation of source code, next convert each node into a vector representation using sentence embedding, which retains the dependencies between nodes. Finally input it into the SAT architecture model for training, and judge whether the input program contains vulnerabilities according to the output results.

Our method includes two significant contributions: a novel approach for generating synthetic code graphs and a graph-to-code transformer to convert code graphs into their code representation.

Wang S.; Wang X.; Sun K.; Jajodia S.; Wang H.; Li Q.,GraphSPD: Graph-Based Security Patch Detection with Enriched Code Semantics,"With the increasing popularity of open-source software, embedded vulnerabilities have been widely propagating to downstream software. Due to different maintenance policies, software vendors may silently release security patches without providing sufficient advisories (e.g., CVE). This leaves users unaware of security patches and provides attackers good chances to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities. Thus, detecting those silent security patches becomes imperative for secure software maintenance. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network based security patch detection system named GraphSPD, which represents patches as graphs with richer semantics and utilizes a patch-tailored graph model for detection. We first develop a novel graph structure called PatchCPG to represent software patches by merging two code property graphs (CPGs) for the pre-patch and post-patch source code as well as retaining the context, deleted, and added components for the patch. By applying a slicing technique, we retain the most relevant context and reduce the size of PatchCPG. Then, we develop the first end-to-end deep learning model called PatchGNN to determine if a patch is security-related directly from its graph-structured PatchCPG. PatchGNN includes a new embedding process to convert PatchCPG into a numeric format and a new multi-attributed graph convolution mechanism to adapt diverse relationships in PatchCPG. The experimental results show GraphSPD can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on security patch detection.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166049487&doi=10.1109%2fSP46215.2023.10179479&partnerID=40&md5=7406fabfa206c6c0509c0e2a440c0d44,Proceedings - IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

The results demonstrate that TS-GGNN has the best vulnerability detection performance, with an accuracy of 99.4%, a precision of 98.81%, and an F1 score as high as 99.4% thereby validating the effectiveness of the TS-GGNN model in capturing features relevant to software vulnerabilities.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163405645&doi=10.1109%2fCISCE58541.2023.10142859&partnerID=40&md5=858b0ff35c1046eeefb38744e97cc35f,"2023 5th International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering, CISCE 2023",Yes,Include,I2.1,"","",""
Wang Z.; Meng S.; Chen Y.,Vulnerability Detection with Representation Learning,"It is essential to identify potentially vulnerable code in our software systems. Deep neural network techniques have been used for vulnerability detection. However, existing methods usually ignore the feature representation of vulnerable datasets, resulting in unsatisfactory model performance. Such vulnerability detection techniques should achieve high accuracy, relatively high true-positive rate, and low false-negative rate. At the same time, it needs to be able to complete the vulnerability detection of actual projects and does not require additional expert knowledge or tedious configuration. In this article, we propose and implement VDDRL (A Vulnerability Detection Method Based On Deep Representation Learning). This deep representation learning-based vulnerability detection method combines feature extraction and ensemble learning. VDDRL uses the word2vec model to convert the source code into a vector representation. Deep representations of vulnerable code are learned from vulnerable code token sequences using LSTM models and then trained for classification using traditional machine learning algorithms. The training dataset we use is derived from actual projects and contains seven different types of vulnerabilities. Through comparative experiments on datasets, VDDRL achieves an Accuracy of 95.6%–98.7%, a Precision of 91.6%–99.0%, a Recall of 84.7%–99.5%, and an F1 of 88.1%–99.2%. Both perform better than the baseline method. Our experimental results show that VDDRL is a generic, lightweight, and extensible vulnerability detection method. Compared with other methods, it has better performance and robustness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151064354&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-99-0272-9_8&partnerID=40&md5=dc655cbd775e4d02c08f789b50ed3e9f,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Yes,Exclude,E1.1,"",Include,Exclude
Kraker W.D.; Vranken H.; Hommmersom A.,GLICE: Combining Graph Neural Networks and Program Slicing to Improve Software Vulnerability Detection,"This paper introduces the GLICE (Graph Neural Network with program slice) model for static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities in source code. GLICE combines inter-procedural program slicing with a Graph Neural Network. It builds upon and extends prior work that applies program slicing (as in the SySeVR model) and Graph Neural Networks (as in the FUNDED model) for vulnerability detection. We apply GLICE on a data set of C/C++ code samples with out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) and out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) butter overflow vulnerabilities. We perform experiments with GLICE to evaluate trade-offs in the depth of the inter-procedural analysis, and to compare GLICE with prior models by evaluating the effectiveness for vulnerability detection and the usage of resources. Our experimental results show that detection accuracy of GLICE improves up to 13% when compared to FUNDED, while the time required to train the GLICE model is about 9 times smaller. GLICE allows configuring the depth of the interprocedural analysis. Our experimental results show that increasing the depth will improve detection, which however requires more computing resources. This allows a user of GLICE to steer the trade-off between detection accuracy and computational efficiency.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168239975&doi=10.1109%2fEuroSPW59978.2023.00009&partnerID=40&md5=8defe123556105593a18ef221e5cdfa6,"Proceedings - 8th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops, Euro S and PW 2023",Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","",Include,
Abdelaziz T.; Hobor A.,Smart Learning to Find Dumb Contracts,"We introduce Deep Learning Vulnerability Analyzer (DLVA), a vulnerability detection tool for Ethereum smart contracts based on powerful deep learning techniques for sequential data adapted for bytecode. We train DLVA to judge bytecode even though the supervising oracle, Slither, can only judge source code. DLVA’s training algorithm is general: we “extend” a source code analysis to bytecode without any manual feature engineering, predefined patterns, or expert rules. DLVA’s training algorithm is also robust: it overcame a 1.25% error rate mislabeled contracts, and—the student surpassing the teacher—found vulnerable contracts that Slither mislabeled. In addition to extending a source code analyzer to bytecode, DLVA is much faster than conventional tools for smart contract vulnerability detection based on formal methods: DLVA checks contracts for 29 vulnerabilities in 0.2 seconds, a 10–1,000x speedup compared to traditional tools. DLVA has three key components. First, Smart Contract to Vector (SC2V) uses neural networks to map arbitrary smart contract bytecode to an high-dimensional floating-point vector. We benchmark SC2V against 4 state-of-the-art graph neural networks and show that it improves model differentiation by an average of 2.2%. Second, Sibling Detector (SD) classifies contracts when a target contract’s vector is Euclidian-close to a labeled contract’s vector in a training set; although only able to judge 55.7% of the contracts in our test set, it has an average Slither-predictive accuracy of 97.4% with a false positive rate of only 0.1%. Third, Core Classifier (CC) uses neural networks to infer vulnerable contracts regardless of vector distance. We benchmark DLVA’s CC with 10 “off-the-shelf” machine learning techniques and show that the CC improves average accuracy by 11.3%. Overall, DLVA predicts Slither’s labels with an overall accuracy of 92.7% and associated false positive rate of 7.2%. Lastly, we benchmark DLVA against nine well-known smart contract analysis tools. Despite using much less analysis time, DLVA completed every query, leading the pack with an average accuracy of 99.7%, pleasingly balancing high true positive rates with low false positive rates. © USENIX Security 2023.

Wang J.; Huang M.; Nie Y.; Kuang X.; Li X.; Zhong W.,Fine-Grained Source Code Vulnerability Detection via Graph Neural Networks,"Although the number of exploitable vulnerabilities in software continues to increase, the speed of bug fixes and software updates have not increased accordingly. It is therefore crucial to analyze the source code and identify vulnerabilities in the early phase of software development. However, vulnerability location in most of the current machine learning-based methods tends to concentrate at the function level. It undoubtedly imposes a burden on further manual code audits when faced with large-scale source code projects. In this paper, a fine-grained source code vulnerability detection model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is proposed with the aim of locating vulnerabilities at the function level and line level.

Detecting and refactoring such problems has been a popular topic in software refactoring, and many detection approaches have been proposed. In past years, the approaches based on metrics or rules have been the leading way in long method detection. However, the approach based on deep learning has also attracted extensive attention in recent studies. In this paper, we propose a graph-based deep learning approach to de-tect Long Method. The key point of our approach is that we extended the PDG (Program Dependency Graph) into a Directed-Heterogeneous Graph as the input graph and used the GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) to build a graph neural network for Long Method detection. Moreover, to get substantial data samples for the deep learning task, we propose a novel semi-automatic approach to generate a large number of data samples.

Guo W.; Fang Y.; Huang C.; Ou H.; Lin C.; Guo Y.,HyVulDect: A hybrid semantic vulnerability mining system based on graph neural network,"In recent years, software programs tend to be large and complex, software has become the infrastructure of modern society, but software security issues can not be ignored. software vulnerabilities have become one of the main threats to computer security. There are countless cases of exploiting source code vulnerabilities to launch attacks. At the same time, the development of open source software has made source code vulnerability detection more and more critical. Traditional vulnerability mining methods have been unable to meet the security analysis needs of complex software because of the high false-positive rate and false-negative rate. To resolve the existing problems, we propose a graph neural network vulnerability mining system named HyVulDect based on hybrid semantics, which constructs a composite semantic code property graph for code representation based on the causes of vulnerabilities. A gated graph neural network is used to extract deep semantic information. Since most of the vulnerabilities are data flow associated, we use taint analysis to extract the taint propagation chain, use the BiLSTM model to extract the token-level features of the context, and finally use the classifier to classify the fusion features. We introduce a dual-attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on vulnerability-related code, making it more suitable for vulnerability mining tasks. The experimental results show that HyVulDect outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and can achieve an accuracy rate of 92% on the benchmark dataset.

CAGs make the source code representation aligned with the task of vulnerability classification and reduce the graph size to accelerate model training with minimum impact on the prediction performance. We have applied CAGs to six GNN models and large Java/C datasets with 114 vulnerability types in Java programs and 106 vulnerability types in C programs. The experiment results show that the GNN models have performed well, with accuracy ranging from 94.7% to 96.3% on the Java dataset and from 91.6% to 93.2% on the C dataset. The resultant GNN models have achieved promising performance when applied to more than 2,500 vulnerabilities collected from real-world software projects. The results also show that using CAGs for GNN models is significantly better than ASTs, CFGs (Control Flow Graphs), and PDGs (Program Dependence Graphs).

Liu Z.; Fang Y.; Huang C.; Xu Y.,MFXSS: An effective XSS vulnerability detection method in JavaScript based on multi-feature model,"The widespread use of web applications has also made them more vulnerable to hackers, resulting in the leakage of large amounts of application and personal privacy data. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are one of the most significant threats to web applications. Attackers can inject scripts to control the victim's browser to send data or execute commands, leading to the theft of privacy or the hijacking of login tokens. Therefore, we proposed a multi-feature fusion-based neural network vulnerability detection model for detecting XSS vulnerabilities in the JavaScript source code of websites (We termed our implementation of this approach MFXSS). We combine abstract syntax tree (AST) and code control flow graph (CFG) to convert the generalized sample data into graph structure and code string structure. Then, through the graph convolutional neural network, weighted aggregation, and the bidirectional recurrent neural network, the logical call features and the context execution relationship features of the source code are extracted and fused respectively. Finally, the fused feature vectors are used to detect and predict XSS vulnerabilities in JavaScript. In the experiment, we designed multiple control experiments to verify that the model construction is optimal, and the accuracy rates in the standard and variant datasets are 0.997 and 0.986. Moreover, in comparing similar detection schemes, MFXSS also performs better.

Cheng X.; Zhang G.; Wang H.; Sui Y.,Path-sensitive code embedding via contrastive learning for software vulnerability detection,"Machine learning and its promising branch deep learning have shown success in a wide range of application domains. Recently, much effort has been expended on applying deep learning techniques (e.g., graph neural networks) to static vulnerability detection as an alternative to conventional bug detection methods. To obtain the structural information of code, current learning approaches typically abstract a program in the form of graphs (e.g., data-flow graphs, abstract syntax trees), and then train an underlying classification model based on the (sub)graphs of safe and vulnerable code fragments for vulnerability prediction. However, these models are still insufficient for precise bug detection, because the objective of these models is to produce classification results rather than comprehending the semantics of vulnerabilities, e.g., pinpoint bug triggering paths, which are essential for static bug detection. This paper presents ContraFlow, a selective yet precise contrastive value-flow embedding approach to statically detect software vulnerabilities. The novelty of ContraFlow lies in selecting and preserving feasible value-flow (aka program dependence) paths through a pretrained path embedding model using self-supervised contrastive learning, thus significantly reducing the amount of labeled data required for training expensive downstream models for path-based vulnerability detection. We evaluated ContraFlow using 288 real-world projects by comparing eight recent learning-based approaches. ContraFlow outperforms these eight baselines by up to 334.1%, 317.9%, 58.3% for informedness, markedness and F1 Score, and achieves up to 450.0%, 192.3%, 450.0% improvement for mean statement recall, mean statement precision and mean IoU respectively in terms of locating buggy statements.  © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136799873&doi=10.1145%2f3533767.3534371&partnerID=40&md5=e74c09d0c019b5dec610654bd695b380,ISSTA 2022 - Proceedings of the 31st ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,Yes,Include,I2.1,"",Include,
Lin C.; Xu Y.; Fang Y.; Liu Z.,VulEye: A Novel Graph Neural Network Vulnerability Detection Approach for PHP Application,"Following advances in machine learning and deep learning processing, cyber security experts are committed to creating deep intelligent approaches for automatically detecting software vulnerabilities. Nowadays, many practices are for C and C++ programs, and methods rarely target PHP application. Moreover, many of these methods use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) but not GNN (Graph Neural Networks) to learn the token dependencies within the source code through different transformations. That may lose a lot of semantic information in terms of code representation. This article presents a novel Graph Neural Network vulnerability detection approach, VulEye, for PHP applications. VulEye can assist security researchers in finding vulnerabilities in PHP projects quickly. VulEye first constructs the PDG (Program Dependence Graph) of the PHP source code, slices PDG with sensitive functions contained in the source code into sub-graphs called SDG (Sub-Dependence Graph), and then makes SDG the model input to train with a Graph Neural Network model which contains three stack units with a GCN layer, Top-k pooling layer, and attention layer, and finally uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and softmax as a classifier to predict if the SDG is vulnerable. We evaluated VulEye on the PHP vulnerability test suite in Software Assurance Reference Dataset. The experiment reports show that the best macro-average F1 score of the VulEye reached 99% in the binary classification task and 95% in the multi-classes classification task. VulEye achieved the best result compared with the existing open-source vulnerability detection implements and other state-of-art deep learning models.

We propose a novel deep learning framework, LineVD, which formulates statement-level vulnerability detection as a node classification task. LineVD leverages control and data dependencies between statements using graph neural networks, and a transformer-based model to encode the raw source code tokens. In particular, by addressing the conflicting outputs between function-level and statement-level information, LineVD significantly improve the prediction performance without vulnerability status for function code.

Wu Y.; Zou D.; Dou S.; Yang W.; Xu D.; Jin H.,VulCNN: An Image-inspired Scalable Vulnerability Detection System,"Since deep learning (DL) can automatically learn features from source code, it has been widely used to detect source code vulnerability. To achieve scalable vulnerability scanning, some prior studies intend to process the source code directly by treating them as text. To achieve accurate vulnerability detection, other approaches consider distilling the program semantics into graph representations and using them to detect vulnerability. In practice, text-based techniques are scalable but not accurate due to the lack of program semantics. Graph-based methods are accurate but not scalable since graph analysis is typically time-consuming. In this paper, we aim to achieve both scalability and accuracy on scanning large-scale source code vulnerabilities. Inspired by existing DL-based image classification which has the ability to analyze millions of images accurately, we prefer to use these techniques to accomplish our purpose. Specifically, we propose a novel idea that can efficiently convert the source code of a function into an image while preserving the program details. We implement Vul-CNN and evaluate it on a dataset of 13,687 vulnerable functions and 26,970 non-vulnerable functions. Experimental results report that VulCNN can achieve better accuracy than eight state-of-the-art vul-nerability detectors (i.e., Checkmarx, FlawFinder, RATS, TokenCNN, VulDeePecker, SySeVR, VulDeeLocator, and Devign). As for scalability, VulCNN is about four times faster than VulDeePecker and SySeVR, about 15 times faster than VulDeeLocator, and about six times faster than Devign.

It is realized by graph-based code representation learning with (i) a lightweight analysis to construct a joint graph of CFG, DFG and AST for each method without requiring a build environment so as to comprehensively characterize statement syntax and semantics and (ii) an attention-based graph neural network to learn statement embeddings in order to distinguish different types of potentially signaled runtime exceptions with interpretability.

Yan G.; Chen S.; Bail Y.; Li X.,Can Deep Learning Models Learn the Vulnerable Patterns for Vulnerability Detection?,"Deep learning has been widely used for the security issue of vulnerability prediction. However, it is confusing to explain how a deep learning model makes decisions on the prediction, although such a model achieves a good performance. Meanwhile, it is also difficult to discover which part of the source code is concentrated on by this black-box model. To this end, we present an empirical evaluation to explore how the deep learning model works on predicting vulnerability and whether it precisely captures the critical code segments to represent the vulnerable patterns. First of all, we build a new vulnerability dataset, called Juliet+, in which vulnerability-related code lines of both positive (bad) and negative (good) samples are labeled manually with substantial efforts, based on the Juliet Test Suite. After that, four deep learning models by leveraging attention mechanisms are empirically implemented to detect vulnerability through mining vulnerable patterns from the source code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of such four models and to analyze the interpretability with evaluation metrics such as Hit@k. The empirical experiment results reveal that the deep learning models with attention, to some extent, can focus on the vulnerability-related code segments that are profitable to interpret the result of vulnerability detection, especially when we adopt the graph neural network model. We further investigate what factors affect the interpretability of models including the class distribution, the number of samples, and the differences of sample features. We find the graph neural network model performs better on part of the dataset which contains balanced and sufficient samples with obvious differences between vulnerable and non-vulnerable patterns. © 2022 IEEE.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136989786&doi=10.1109%2fCOMPSAC54236.2022.00142&partnerID=40&md5=7dae859cbf5309de1a4c77fa15eb9138,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE 46th Annual Computers, Software, and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2022",Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Wu B.; Liu S.; Feng R.; Xie X.; Siow J.; Lin S.,Enhancing Security Patch Identification by Capturing Structures in Commits,"With the rapid increasing number of open source software (OSS), the majority of the software vulnerabilities in the open source components are fixed silently, which leads to the deployed software that integrated them being unable to get a timely update. Hence, it is critical to design a security patch identification system to ensure the security of the utilized software. However, most of the existing works for security patch identification just consider the changed code and the commit message of a commit as a flat sequence of tokens with simple neural networks to learn its semantics, while the structure information is ignored. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose our well-designed approach E-SPI, which extracts the structure information hidden in a commit for effective identification. Specifically, it consists of the code change encoder to extract the syntactic of the changed code with the BiLSTM to learn the code representation and the message encoder to construct the dependency graph for the commit message with the graph neural network (GNN) to learn the message representation. We further enhance the code change encoder by embedding contextual information related to the changed code. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct the extensive experiments against six state-of-the-art approaches on the existing dataset and from the real deployment environment. The experimental results confirm that our approach can significantly outperform current state-of-the-art baselines.

Cao S.; Sun X.; Bo L.; Wei Y.; Li B.,BGNN4VD: Constructing Bidirectional Graph Neural-Network for Vulnerability Detection,"Context: Previous studies have shown that existing deep learning-based approaches can significantly improve the performance of vulnerability detection. They represent code in various forms and mine vulnerability features with deep learning models. However, the differences of code representation forms and deep learning models make various approaches still have some limitations. In practice, their false-positive rate (FPR) and false-negative rate (FNR) are still high. Objective: To address the limitations of existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection approaches, we propose BGNN4VD (Bidirectional Graph Neural Network for Vulnerability Detection), a vulnerability detection approach by constructing a Bidirectional Graph Neural-Network (BGNN). Method: In Phase 1, we extract the syntax and semantic information of source code through abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and data flow graph (DFG). Then in Phase 2, we use vectorized source code as input to Bidirectional Graph Neural-Network (BGNN). In Phase 3, we learn the different features between vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code by introducing backward edges on the basis of traditional Graph Neural-Network (GNN). Finally in Phase 4, a Convolutional Neural-Network (CNN) is used to further extract features and detect vulnerabilities through a classifier. Results: We evaluate BGNN4VD on four popular C/C++ projects from NVD and GitHub, and compare it with four state-of-the-art (Flawfinder, RATS, SySeVR, and VUDDY) vulnerab ility detection approaches. Experiment results show that, when compared these baselines, BGNN4VD achieves 4.9%, 11.0%, and 8.4% improvement in F1-measure, accuracy and precision, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed BGNN4VD achieves a higher precision and accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.

However, lacking fine-grained analysis of the code has rendered the existing solutions still suffering from low performance; besides, the explosive growth of open-source projects has dramatically increased the complexity and diversity of the source code. This paper presents HGVul, a code vulnerability detection method based on heterogeneous intermediate representation of source code. The key of the proposed method is the fine-grained handling on heterogeneous source-level intermediate representation (SIR) without expert knowledge. It first extracts graph SIR of code with multiple syntactic-semantic information. Then, HGVul splits the SIR into different subgraphs according to various semantic relations, which are used to obtain semantic information conveyed by different types of edges. Next, a graph neural network with attention operations is deployed on each subgraph to learn representation, which captures the subtle effects from node neighbors on their representation. Finally, the learned code feature representations are utilized to perform vulnerability detection. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets. The F1 of HGVul reaches 96.1% on the sample-balanced Big-Vul-VP dataset and 88.3% on the unbalanced Big-Vul dataset.

This becomes even more important in today's software ecosystem, where vulnerable code can flow easily and unwittingly within and across software repositories like GitHub. Across such millions of lines of code, traditional static and dynamic approaches struggle to scale. Although existing machine-learning-based approaches look promising in such a setting, most work detects vulnerable code at a higher granularity - at the method or file level. Thus, developers still need to inspect a significant amount of code to locate the vulnerable statement(s) that need to be fixed. This paper presents Velvet, a novel ensemble learning approach to locate vulnerable statements. Our model combines graph-based and sequence-based neural networks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program graph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. To study Velvet's effectiveness, we use an off-the-shelf synthetic dataset and a recently published real-world dataset. In the static analysis setting, where vulnerable functions are not detected in advance, Velvet achieves 4.5× better performance than the baseline static analyzers on the real-world data. For the isolated vulnerability localization task, where we assume the vulnerability of a function is known while the specific vulnerable statement is unknown, we compare Velvet with several neural networks that also attend to local and global context of code.

Although various data-driven vulnerability detection methods have been proposed, the task remains challenging since the diversity and complexity of real-world vulnerable code in syntax and semantics make it difficult to extract vulnerable features with regular deep learning models, especially in analyzing a large program. Moreover, the fact that real-world vulnerable codes contain a lot of redundant information unrelated to vulnerabilities will further aggravate the above problem.

However, software vulnerabilities are diverse, and mining vulnerabilities through source code requires a high level of professional experience for developers. Previous vulnerability detection solutions either relied on expert-defined features or used recursive neural networks only for code sequences, making it difficult to extract complex features of vulnerabilities in the traditional code space. In recent years, with the booming development of artificial intelligence technology, some scholars have started to try to combine graph neural networks to extract graph structure information of source code for software vulnerability detection. In this paper, by introducing a method based on Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) combined with a self-attention aggregation mechanism for vulnerability detection, we achieve superior detection results.

For the code coverage information, DeepRL4FL first orders the test cases and marks error-exhibiting code statements, expecting that a model can recognize the patterns discriminating between faulty and non-faulty statements/methods. For dependencies among statements, the suspiciousness of a statement is seen taking into account the data dependencies to other statements in execution and data flows, in addition to the statement by itself. Finally, the vector representations for code coverage matrix, data dependencies among statements, and source code are combined and used as the input of a classifier built from a Convolution Neural Network to detect buggy statements/methods. Our empirical evaluation shows that DeepRL4FL improves the top-1 results over the state-of-the-art statement-level FL baselines from 173.1% to 491.7%. It also improves the top-1 results over the existing method-level FL baselines from 15.0% to 206.3%.  © 2021 IEEE.",Conference paper,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115690270&doi=10.1109%2fICSE43902.2021.00067&partnerID=40&md5=737eed969785228e7fac690efc32c8fd,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,Yes,Exclude,"E1.3,E2.2","",Include,

Existing solutions to this problem are mostly based on features that are defined by human experts and directly lead to missed potential vulnerability. Deep learning is an effective method for automating the extraction of vulnerability characteristics. Our paper proposes intelligent and automated vulnerability detection while using deep representation learning and heterogeneous ensemble learning. Firstly, we transform sample data from source code by removing segments that are unrelated to the vulnerability in order to reduce code analysis and improve detection efficiency in our experiments. Secondly, we represent the sample data as real vectors by pre-training on the corpus and maintaining its semantic information. Thirdly, the vectors are fed to a deep learning model to obtain the features of vulnerability. Lastly, we train a heterogeneous ensemble classifier. We analyze the effectiveness and resource consumption of different network models, pre-training methods, classifiers, and vulnerabilities separately in order to evaluate the detection method. We also compare our approach with some well-known vulnerability detection commercial tools and academic methods.

Deep learning based methods have been widely used in vulnerability detection in recent years. Since the inherent graph structure of source code contains rich semantics, many deep learning works have exploited graph neural networks to enhance code representation. Despite their novel design, learning the structural information in the graph hierarchically and focusing on important nodes are still problems to better capture vulnerability semantics. To tackle this bottleneck, we propose a novel neural model for vulnerability detection. A SAGPool module is designed to automatically chooses important nodes to retain hierarchically in each graph convolution layer.

Li X.; Wang L.; Xin Y.; Yang Y.; Chen Y.,Automated vulnerability detection in source code using minimum intermediate representation learning,"Vulnerability is one of the root causes of network intrusion. An effective way to mitigate security threats is to discover and patch vulnerabilities before an attack. Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely on manual participation and incur a high false positive rate. The intelligent vulnerability detection methods suffer from the problems of long-term dependence, out of vocabulary, coarse detection granularity and lack of vulnerable samples. This paper proposes an automated and intelligent vulnerability detection method in source code based on the minimum intermediate representation learning. First, the sample in the form of source code is transformed into a minimum intermediate representation to exclude the irrelevant items and reduce the length of the dependency. Next, the intermediate representation is transformed into a real value vector through pre-training on an extended corpus, and the structure and semantic information are retained. Then, the vector is fed to three concatenated convolutional neural networks to obtain high-level features of vulnerability. Last, a classifier is trained using the learned features. To validate this vulnerability detection method, an experiment was performed.

Funded leverages the advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop a novel graph-based learning method to capture and reason about the program's control, data, and call dependencies. Unlike prior work that treats the program as a sequential sequence or an untyped graph, Funded learns and operates on a graph representation of the program source code, in which individual statements are connected to other statements through relational edges. By capturing the program syntax, semantics and flows, Funded finds better code representation for the downstream software vulnerability detection task. To provide sufficient training data to build an effective deep learning model, we combine probabilistic learning and statistical assessments to automatically gather high-quality training samples from open-source projects. This provides many real-life vulnerable code training samples to complement the limited vulnerable code samples available in standard vulnerability databases.

Recently, the machine learning (ML)-based approach has attracted increasing interest in the research of software vulnerability detection. However, the detection performance of existing ML-based methods require further improvement. There are two challenges: one is code representation for ML and the other is class imbalance between vulnerable code and nonvulnerable code. To overcome these challenges, this article develops a DeepBalance system, which combines the new ideas of deep code representation learning and fuzzy-based class rebalancing. We design a deep neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory to learn invariant and discriminative code representations from labeled vulnerable and nonvulnerable code. Then, a new fuzzy oversampling method is employed to rebalance the training data by generating synthetic samples for the class of vulnerable code. To evaluate the performance of the new system, we carry out a series of experiments in a real-world ground-truth dataset that consists of the code from the projects of LibTIFF, LibPNG, and FFmpeg.

Intuitively, the quality of code change representations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Prior work on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representation approaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code change encoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill this gap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach named CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for diverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as the combination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trained code model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses a novel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed code fragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. To evaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-related tasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctness assessment, and just-in-time defect prediction.

Selecting a reviewer who lacks expertise and understanding can slow development or result in more defects. To date, most reviewer recommendation systems rely primarily on historical file change and review information; those who changed or reviewed a file in the past are the best positioned to review in the future.We posit that while these approaches are able to identify and suggest qualified reviewers, they may be blind to reviewers who have the needed expertise and have simply never interacted with the changed files before. Fortunately, at Microsoft, we have a wealth of work artifacts across many repositories that can yield valuable information about our developers. To address the aforementioned problem, we present Coral, a novel approach to reviewer recommendation that leverages a socio-technical graph built from the rich set of entities (developers, repositories, files, pull requests (PRs), work items, etc.) and their relationships in modern source code management systems. We employ a graph convolutional neural network on this graph and train it on two and a half years of history on 332 repositories within Microsoft.We show that Coral is able to model the manual history of reviewer selection remarkably well. Further, based on an extensive user study, we demonstrate that this approach identifies relevant and qualified reviewers who traditional reviewer recommenders miss, and that these developers desire to be included in the review process. Finally, we find that ""classical""reviewer recommendation systems perform better on smaller (in terms of developers) software projects while Coral excels on larger projects, suggesting that there is ""no one model to rule them all."" © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167921721&doi=10.1109%2fICSE-SEIP58684.2023.00020&partnerID=40&md5=a0274a779711b1042772bf9e7a85e888,Proceedings - International Conference on Software Engineering,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","",Include,
Dong J.; Lou Y.; Zhu Q.; Sun Z.; Li Z.; Zhang W.; Hao D.,FIRA: Fine-Grained Graph-Based Code Change Representation for Automated Commit Message Generation,"Commit messages summarize code changes of each commit in nat-ural language, which help developers understand code changes without digging into detailed implementations and play an essen-tial role in comprehending software evolution. To alleviate human efforts in writing commit messages, researchers have proposed var-ious automated techniques to generate commit messages, including template-based, information retrieval-based, and learning-based techniques. Although promising, previous techniques have limited effectiveness due to their coarse-grained code change representations. This work proposes a novel commit message generation technique, FIRA, which first represents code changes via fine-grained graphs and then learns to generate commit messages automati-cally. Different from previous techniques, FIRA represents the code changes with fine-grained graphs, which explicitly describe the code edit operations between the old version and the new version, and code tokens at different granularities (i.e., sub-tokens and integral tokens). Based on the graph-based representation, FIRA generates commit messages by a generation model, which includes a graph-neural-network-based encoder and a transformer-based decoder. To make both sub-tokens and integral tokens as available ingredients for commit message generation, the decoder is further incorporated with a novel dual copy mechanism.

Yousofvand L.; Soleimani S.; Rafe V.,Automatic bug localization using a combination of deep learning and model transformation through node classification,"Bug localization is the task of automatically locating suspicious commands in the source code. Many automated bug localization approaches have been proposed for reducing costs and speeding up the bug localization process. These approaches allow developers to focus on critical commands. In this paper, we propose to treat the bug localization problem as a node classification problem. As in the existing training sets, where whole graphs are labeled as buggy and bug-free, it is required first to label all nodes in each graph. To do this, we use the Gumtree algorithm, which labels the nodes by comparing the buggy graphs with their corresponding fixed graphs. In classification, we propose to use a type of graph neural networks (GNNs), GraphSAGE. The used dataset for training and testing is JavaScript buggy code and their corresponding fixed code. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other related methods. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150659552&doi=10.1007%2fs11219-023-09625-5&partnerID=40&md5=ca9ae9885894b791b4c68c220de3be7f,Software Quality Journal,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Xu Z.; Lu K.; Sheng V.S.,Logic Error Localization and Correction with Machine Learning,"We aim to propose a system repairing programs with logic errors to be functionally correct among different programming languages. Logic error program repair has always been a thorny problem: First, a logic error is usually harder to repair than a syntax error in a program because it has no diagnostic feedback from compilers. Second, it requires inferring in different ranges (i.e., the distance of related code lines) and tracking symbols across its pseudocode, source code, and test cases. Third, the logic error datasets are scarce, since an ideal logic error dataset should contain lots of components during the development procedure of a program, including a program specification, pseudocode, source code, test cases, and test reports (i.e., test case failure report). In our work, we propose novel solutions to these challenges. First, we introduce pseudocode information to assist logic error localization and correction. We construct a code-pseudocode graph to connect symbols across a source code and its pseudocode and then apply a graph neural network to localize and correct logic errors. Second, we collect logic errors generated in the process of syntax error repairing via DrRepair from 500 programs in the SPoC dataset and reconstruct them to our single logic error dataset, which we leverage to train and evaluate our models. Our experimental results show that we achieve 99.39% localization accuracy and 19.20% full repair accuracy on logic errors with five-fold cross-validation. Based on our current work, we will replenish and construct more complete public logic error datasets and propose a novel system to comprehend different programming languages from several perspectives and correct logic errors to be functionally correct.

Zhang J.; Wang X.; Zhang H.; Sun H.; Liu X.; Hu C.; Liu Y.,Detecting Condition-Related Bugs with Control Flow Graph Neural Network,"Automated bug detection is essential for high-quality software development and has attracted much attention over the years. Among the various bugs, previous studies show that the condition expressions are quite error-prone and the condition-related bugs are commonly found in practice. Traditional approaches to automated bug detection are usually limited to compilable code and require tedious manual effort. Recent deep learning-based work tends to learn general syntactic features based on Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or apply the existing Graph Neural Networks over program graphs. However, AST-based neural models may miss important control flow information of source code, and existing Graph Neural Networks for bug detection tend to learn local neighbourhood structure information. Generally, the condition-related bugs are highly influenced by control flow knowledge, therefore we propose a novel CFG-based Graph Neural Network (CFGNN) to automatically detect condition-related bugs, which includes a graph-structured LSTM unit to efficiently learn the control flow knowledge and long-distance context information. We also adopt the API-usage attention mechanism to leverage the API knowledge. To evaluate the proposed approach, we collect real-world bugs in popular GitHub repositories and build a large-scale condition-related bug dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for detecting condition-related bugs.  © 2023 ACM.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167727229&doi=10.1145%2f3597926.3598142&partnerID=40&md5=d1528e96d16abc5373ecd30bb07bcb45,ISSTA 2023 - Proceedings of the 32nd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

Because such an oracle can be imperfect, the generated patches, although validated by the oracle, may actually be incorrect. While the state-of-the-art explores research directions that require dynamic information or rely on manually-crafted heuristics, we study the benefit of learning code representations in order to learn deep features that may encode the properties of patch correctness. Our empirical work investigates different representation learning approaches for code changes to derive embeddings that are amenable to similarity computations of patch correctness identification, and assess the possibility of accurate classification of correct patch by combining learned embeddings with engineered features. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of learned embeddings to empower Leopard (a patch correctness predicting framework implemented in this work) with learning algorithms in reasoning about patch correctness: a machine learning predictor with BERT transformer-based learned embeddings associated with XGBoost achieves an AUC value of about 0.803 in the prediction of patch correctness on a new dataset of 2,147 labeled patches that we collected for the experiments. Our investigations show that deep learned embeddings can lead to complementary/better performance when comparing against the state-of-the-art, PATCH-SIM, which relies on dynamic information. By combining deep learned embeddings and engineered features, Panther (the upgraded version of Leopard implemented in this work) outperforms Leopard with higher scores in terms of AUC, +Recall and -Recall, and can accurately identify more (in)correct patches that cannot be predicted by the classifiers only with learned embeddings or engineered features.

Tang F.; He P.,Software Defect Prediction using Multi-scale Structural Information,"In recent years, most researches have used the sequence of nodes in the abstract syntax tree (AST) of code to extract features for software defect prediction (SDP). While the AST is a kind of graph data, it may ignore some part of the structural information to use the original graph data as a sequence for input. Thus, Graph neural network (GNN) has been used to extract structural information in SDP. However, existing researches ignore that GNN learning is inherently local. It is difficult to interact between remote nodes and to capture long-term dependencies in source code. We apply a combination model of GNN Transformer to predict the software defects. Using an AST directly as the input, GNN extracts local features and structural information between the node and its neighbors. We then encode the relative and absolute positions of the nodes in the AST. The position encodings are passed into the Transformer along with the feature information extracted by GNN to extract the global features, which are the long-term dependencies between nodes. Finally, the extracted fused features are used in the SDP. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset have shown that our method achieves higher F-measure and better identification of defective features in source code than the state-of-the-art SDP method. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168248665&doi=10.1145%2f3594315.3594371&partnerID=40&md5=eebaffafd0ee850460b3597b2d4f44c6,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Yin G.; Wang W.; Li H.,OdegVul: An Approach for Statement-Level Defect Prediction,"Defect prediction research has been conducted for more than 40 years, with the goal of estimating the defect-prone blocks of source code. Prior studies, however, had two major limitations: (1) coarse-grained defect prediction results and (2) weak long-Term dependencies modeling. As a result, developers need to review the prediction results to gure out which function or even which line of code produced the issue. In this study, we present OdegVul, a novel statement-level defect prediction model, to address these concerns. To capture both semantic and structural relationships between statements, a statement representation framework combining deep learning and graph neural networks is designed. Then the long-Term dependencies between statements are encoded as a partial di®erential equation of a graph neural network. Through the experiment of 32 releases of 9 open-source Java projects, we found that semantic and structural dependencies are crucial to statement-level defect prediction. OdegVul outperforms other state-of-The-Art (SOTA) predictors and achieves reasonable performance in cross-project statement-level defect prediction scenarios. The ner granularity of predicting results reduces the developer's workforce in reviewing the prediction results and increases the practicality of the defect prediction model.

Yin Y.; Shi Y.; Zhao Y.; Wahab F.,Multi-graph learning-based software defect location,"Software quality is key to the success of software systems. Modern software systems are growing in their worth based on industry needs and becoming more complex, which inevitably increases the possibility of more defects in software systems. Software repairing is time-consuming, especially locating the source files related to specific software defect reports. To locate defective source files more quickly and accurately, automated software defect location technology is generated and has a huge application value. The existing deep learning-based software defect location method focuses on extracting the semantic correlation between the source file and the corresponding defect reports. However, the extensive code structure information contained in the source files is ignored. To this end, we propose a software defect location method, namely, multi-graph learning-based software defect location (MGSDL). By extracting the program dependency graphs for functions, each source file is converted into a graph bag containing multiple graphs (i.e., multi-graph). Further, a multi-graph learning method is proposed, which learns code structure information from multi-graph to establish the semantic association between source files and software defect reports. Experiments' results on four publicly available datasets, AspectJ, Tomcat, Eclipse UI, and SWT, show that MGSDL improves on average 3.88%, 5.66%, 13.23%, 9.47%, and 3.26% over the competitive methods in five evaluation metrics, rank@10, rank@5, MRR, MAP, and AUC, respectively. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152077576&doi=10.1002%2fsmr.2552&partnerID=40&md5=05fae7aae53840e8e104ebbedbcab80e,Journal of Software: Evolution and Process,Yes,Include,,"",Include,
Ma Y.-F.; Du Y.; Li M.,Capturing the Long-Distance Dependency in the Control Flow Graph via Structural-Guided Attention for Bug Localization,"To alleviate the burden of software maintenance, bug localization, which aims to automatically locate the buggy source files based on the bug report, has drawn significant attention in the software mining community. Recent studies indicate that the program structure in source code carries more semantics reflecting the program behavior, which is beneficial for bug localization. Benefiting from the rich structural information in the Control Flow Graph (CFG), CFG-based bug localization methods have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Existing CFG-based methods extract the semantic feature from the CFG via the graph neural network. However, the step-wise feature propagation in the graph neural network suffers from the problem of information loss when the propagation distance is long, while the long-distance dependency is rather common in the CFG. In this paper, we argue that the long-distance dependency is crucial for feature extraction from the CFG, and propose a novel bug localization model named sgAttention. In sgAttention, a particularly designed structural-guided attention is employed to globally capture the information in the CFG, where features of irrelevant nodes are masked for each node to facilitate better feature extraction from the CFG. Experimental results on four widely-used open-source software projects indicate that sgAttention averagely improves the state-of-the-art bug localization methods by 32.9% and 29.2% and the state-of-the-art pre-trained models by 5.8% and 4.9% in terms of MAP and MRR, respectively. © 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Lin B.; Wang S.; Wen M.; Mao X.,Context-Aware Code Change Embedding for Better Patch Correctness Assessment,"Despite the capability in successfully fixing more and more real-world bugs, existing Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques are still challenged by the long-standing overfitting problem (i.e., a generated patch that passes all tests is actually incorrect). Plenty of approaches have been proposed for automated patch correctness assessment (APCA). Nonetheless, dynamic ones (i.e., those that needed to execute tests) are time-consuming while static ones (i.e., those built on top of static code features) are less precise. Therefore, embedding techniques have been proposed recently, which assess patch correctness via embedding token sequences extracted from the changed code of a generated patch. However, existing techniques rarely considered the context information and program structures of a generated patch, which are crucial for patch correctness assessment as revealed by existing studies. In this study, we explore the idea of context-Aware code change embedding considering program structures for patch correctness assessment. Specifically, given a patch, we not only focus on the changed code but also take the correlated unchanged part into consideration, through which the context information can be extracted and leveraged. We then utilize the AST path technique for representation where the structure information from AST node can be captured. Finally, based on several pre-defined heuristics, we build a deep learning based classifier to predict the correctness of the patch. We implemented this idea as Cache and performed extensive experiments to assess its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that Cache can (1) perform better than previous representation learning based techniques (e.g., Cache relatively outperforms existing techniques by 6%, 3%, and 16%, respectively under three diverse experiment settings), and (2) achieve overall higher performance than existing APCA techniques while even being more precise than certain dynamic ones including PATCH-SIM (92.9% vs. 83.0%). Further results reveal that the context information and program structures leveraged by Cache contributed significantly to its outstanding performance.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Article,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130752121&doi=10.1145%2f3505247&partnerID=40&md5=896d9827ba64bf2c9e1c335c5f5a6100,ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,Yes,Include,,"","",""
Zhou C.; He P.; Zeng C.; Ma J.,Software defect prediction with semantic and structural information of codes based on Graph Neural Networks,"Context: Most defect prediction methods consider a series of traditional manually designed static code metrics. However, only using these hand-crafted features is impractical. Some researchers use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture the potential semantic information based on the program's Syntax Trees (ASTs). In recent years, leveraging the dependency relationships between software modules to construct a software network and using network embedding models to capture the structural information have been helpful in defect prediction. This paper simultaneously takes the semantic and structural information into account and proposes a method called CGCN. Objective: This study aims to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method in software defect prediction. Method: Abstract Syntax Trees and a Class Dependency Network (CDN) are first generated based on the source code. For ASTs, symbolic tokens are extracted and encoded into vectors. The numerical vectors are then used as input to the CNN to capture the semantic information. For CDN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is used to learn the structural information of the network automatically. Afterward, the learned semantic and structural information are combined with different weights. Finally, we concatenate the learned features with traditional hand-crafted features to train a classifier for more accurate defect prediction. Results: The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art defect prediction models for both within-project prediction (including within-version and cross-version) and cross-project prediction on 21 open-source projects. In general, within-version prediction achieves better performance in the three prediction tasks.

Despite remarkable success, the state of the art falls short in handling (1) bug reports with diverse characteristics and (2) programs with wildly different behaviors. In response, this paper proposes a graph-based neural model BLOCO for automated bug localization. To be specific, our proposed model decomposes bug reports into several bug clues to capture bug-related information from various perspectives for highly diverse bug reports. To understand the program in depth, we first design a code hierarchical network structure, Code-NoN, based on basic blocks to represent source code files. Correspondingly, a multilayer graph neural network is tailored to capture program behaviors from the Code-NoN structure of each source code file.

Ma Y.-F.; Li M.,The flowing nature matters: feature learning from the control flow graph of source code for bug localization,"Bug localization plays an important role in software maintenance. Traditional works treat the source code from the lexical perspective, while some recent researches indicate that exploiting the program structure is beneficial for improving bug localization. Control flow graph (CFG) is a widely used graph representation, which essentially represents the program structure. Although using graph neural network for feature learning is a straightforward way and has been proven effective in various software mining problems, this approach is inappropriate since adjacent nodes in the CFG could be totally unrelated in semantics. On the other hand, previous statements may affect the semantics of subsequent statements along the execution path, which we call the flowing nature of control flow graph. In this paper, we claim that the flowing nature should be explicitly considered and propose a novel model named cFlow for bug localization, which employs a particular designed flow-based GRU for feature learning from the CFG. The flow-based GRU exploits the program structure represented by the CFG to transmit the semantics of statements along the execution path, which reflects the flowing nature. Experimental results on widely-used real-world software projects show that cFlow significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art bug localization methods, indicating that exploiting the program structure from the CFG with respect to the flowing nature is beneficial for improving bug localization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124741118&doi=10.1007%2fs10994-021-06078-4&partnerID=40&md5=0b5e48501b89aea5d491f3dc8a1b3770,Machine Learning,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I1.2","","",""

First, we propose a framework ALGoF to automatically learn the local semantic and global structural features of code files.

In this paper, inspired by code2vec, we propose a new AST path pair-based source code representation method (PathPair2Vec) and apply it to software project defect prediction. We first propose the concept of the short path to describe each terminal node and its control logic. Then, we design a new sequence encoding method to code the different parts of the terminal node and its control logic. Finally, by pairs of short paths, we describe the semantic information of code and fuse them by an attention mechanism. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset show that our method improves the F1 score by 17.88% over the state-of-the-art SDP method, and the AST path pair-based source code representation can better identify the defect features of the source code. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085928963&doi=10.1016%2fj.cola.2020.100979&partnerID=40&md5=2f38eee29116449336d8e934062d0794,Journal of Computer Languages,Yes,Include,,"",Include,
Zhang X.; Lu Y.; Shi K.,CB-Path2Vec: A Cross Block Path Based Representation for Software Defect Prediction,"Software defects are common in software projects and threaten the security of software. Software defect prediction has been proven to be an effective method to solve software security problems, assisting developers in finding potential errors and effectively allocating test resources, in the early stage of the software life cycle. Traditional defect prediction models are designed based on hand-designed metric features, but these features usually cannot capture the semantic and structural information of code. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel software defect prediction model called CB-Path2Vec, which can automatically learn features composed of Cross Block path for representing source code and use them for software defect prediction. An evaluation on the public PROMISE dataset shows that on average CB-Path2Vec improvements over the state-of-the-art method both on within-project defect prediction (WPDP) and cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). © 2020 IEEE.",Conference paper,2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101683378&doi=10.1109%2fICCC51575.2020.9344956&partnerID=40&md5=168573d2392fdb2ab881db7e179d77a4,"2020 IEEE 6th International Conference on Computer and Communications, ICCC 2020",Yes,Include,,"","",""
Yasunaga M.; Liang P.,"Graph-based, self-supervised program repair from diagnostic feedback","We consider the problem of learning to repair programs from diagnostic feedback (e.g., compiler error messages). Program repair is challenging for two reasons: First, it requires reasoning and tracking symbols across source code and diagnostic feedback. Second, labeled datasets available for program repair are relatively small. In this work, we propose novel solutions to these two challenges. First, we introduce a program-feedback graph, which connects symbols relevant to program repair in source code and diagnostic feedback, and then apply a graph neural network on top to model the reasoning process. Second, we present a self-supervised learning paradigm for program repair that leverages unlabeled programs available online to create a large amount of extra program repair examples, which we use to pre-train our models. We evaluate our proposed approach on two applications: correcting introductory programming assignments (DeepFix dataset) and correcting the outputs of program synthesis (SPoC dataset). Our final system, DrRepair, significantly outperforms prior work, achieving 68.2% full repair rate on DeepFix (+22.9% over the prior best), and 48.4% synthesis success rate on SPoC (+3.7% over the prior best).

Oßner C.; Böhm K.,Graphs for mining-based defect localization in multithreaded programs,"Trends in modern multicore architecture design requires software developers to develop and debug multithreaded programs. Consequently, software developers must face new challenges because of bug patterns occurring at runtime and due to the non-deterministic behavior of multi-threaded program executions. This calls for new defect-localization techniques. There has been much work in the field of defect localization for sequential programs on the one side and on the localization of specific multithreading bugs on the other side, but we are not aware of any general technique for multithreaded programs. This paper proposes such an approach. It generalizes data mining-based defect-localization techniques for sequential programs. The techniques work by analyzing call graphs. More specifically, we propose new graph representations of multithreaded program executions as well as two mining-based localization approaches based on these representations. Our evaluation shows that our technique yields good results and is able to find defects that other approaches cannot localize. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,2013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877803123&doi=10.1007%2fs10766-012-0237-2&partnerID=40&md5=178e4e41a5ebee92727f35645193c127,International Journal of Parallel Programming,Yes,Exclude,E1.1,"",Exclude,
Viet Phan A.; Le Nguyen M.; Thu Bui L.,Convolutional neural networks over control flow graphs for software defect prediction,"Existing defects in software components is unavoidable and leads to not only a waste of time and money but also many serious consequences. To build predictive models, previous studies focus on manually extracting features or using tree representations of programs, and exploiting different machine learning algorithms. However, the performance of the models is not high since the existing features and tree structures often fail to capture the semantics of programs. To explore deeply programs' semantics, this paper proposes to leverage precise graphs representing program execution flows, and deep neural networks for automatically learning defect features. Firstly, control flow graphs are constructed from the assembly instructions obtained by compiling source code; we thereafter apply multi-view multi-layer directed graph-based convolutional neural networks (DGCNNs) to learn semantic features.

Loyola P.; Matsuo Y.,Learning Feature Representations from Change Dependency Graphs for Defect Prediction,"Given the heterogeneity of the data that can be extracted from the software development process, defect prediction techniques have focused on associating different sources of data with the introduction of faulty code, usually relying on handcrafted features. While these efforts have generated considerable progress over the years, little attention has been given to the fact that the performance of any predictive model depends heavily on the representation of the data used, and that different representations can lead to different results. We consider this a relevant problem, as it could be affecting directly the efforts towards generating safer software systems. Therefore, we propose to study the impact of the representation of the data in defect prediction models. To this end, we focus on the use of developer activity data, from which we structure dependency graphs. Then, instead of manually generating features, such as network metrics, we propose two models inspired by recent advances in representation learning which are able to automatically generate feature representations from graph data. These new representations are compared against manually crafted features for defect prediction in real world software projects.

Orvalho P.; Piepenbrock J.; Janota M.; Manquinho V.,Graph Neural Networks for Mapping Variables Between Programs,"Automated program analysis is a pivotal research domain in many areas of Computer Science - Formal Methods and Artificial Intelligence, in particular. Due to the undecidability of the problem of program equivalence, comparing two programs is highly challenging. Typically, in order to compare two programs, a relation between both programs' sets of variables is required. Thus, mapping variables between two programs is useful for a panoply of tasks such as program equivalence, program analysis, program repair, and clone detection. In this work, we propose using graph neural networks (GNNs) to map the set of variables between two programs based on both programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs). To demonstrate the strength of variable mappings, we present three use-cases of these mappings on the task of program repair to fix well-studied and recurrent bugs among novice programmers in introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Experimental results on a dataset of 4166 pairs of incorrect/correct programs show that our approach correctly maps 83% of the evaluation dataset. Moreover, our experiments show that the current state-of-the-art on program repair, greatly dependent on the programs' structure, can only repair about 72% of the incorrect programs.

Nadim M.; Mondal D.; Roy C.K.,Leveraging structural properties of source code graphs for just-in-time bug prediction,"The most common use of data visualization is to minimize the complexity for proper understanding. A graph is one of the most commonly used representations for understanding relational data. It produces a simplified representation of data that is challenging to comprehend if kept in a textual format. In this study, we propose a methodology to utilize the relational properties of source code in the form of a graph to identify Just-in-Time (JIT) bug prediction in software systems during different revisions of software evolution and maintenance. We presented a method to convert the source codes of commit patches to equivalent graph representations and named it Source Code Graph (SCG). To understand and compare multiple source code graphs, we extracted several structural properties of these.graphs, such as the density, number of cycles, nodes, edges, etc. We then utilized the attribute values of those SCGs to visualize and detect buggy software commits. We process more than 246 K software commits from 12 subject systems in this investigation. Our investigation on these 12 open-source software projects written in C++ and Java programming languages shows that if we combine the features from SCG with conventional features used in similar studies, we will get the increased performance of Machine Learning (ML) based buggy commit detection models. We also find the increase of F1 Scores in predicting buggy and non-buggy commits statistically significant using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Since SCG-based feature values represent the style or structural properties of source code updates or changes in the software system, it suggests the importance of careful maintenance of source code style or structure for keeping a software system bug-free. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125647013&doi=10.1007%2fs10515-022-00326-0&partnerID=40&md5=e1bee7a7a259198ea08691007f2c1829,Automated Software Engineering,Yes,Exclude,E2.1,Include,Include,

This paper investigates the performance of graph neural networks on classifying applications given their raw code, for different type of graphs extracted from LLVM's intermediate representation. The results indicate that adding new (different) edges and/or nodes is not a fact of performance improvement. This paper shows a compact representation tends to achieve the best performance.

Also gotten representations can be used for synthesizing source code snippets of certain types. A machine learning approach is used in this work. The training set is formed by augmented abstract syntax trees of Java classes. A graph autoencoder is trained and a latent representation of Java classes graphs is inspected.

For example, long-range dependencies induced by using the same variable or function in distant locations are often not considered. We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures. In this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VARNAMING, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VARMISUSE, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VARMISUSE task in many cases.

Guo J.; Liu J.; Liu X.; Wan Y.; Li L.,Summarizing source code with Heterogeneous Syntax Graph and dual position,"Code summarization attempts to summarize the semantics of source code by automatically producing brief natural-language descriptions. Most existing work proposes to learn from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and plain text of source code for summary generation. However, little attention has been paid to the structural heterogeneity and layout features of source code. In this paper, we present a novel framework titled HETSUM to address these issues. Specifically, a Heterogeneous Syntax Graph (HSG) is first built by designing six types of augmented edges in AST, which indicates the heterogeneous structure of source code. Meanwhile, a dual position is designed for each token in the source code by considering the layout information. Moreover, we develop a heterogeneous graph neural network in HETSUM to encode the HSG while extracting the code layout features with the Transformer encoder. By assimilating the learned code token vectors into the HSG encoder, HETSUM can capture the relations between its two encoders for improved code representation. To facilitate the generation of high-quality summaries, we integrate a copying mechanism into the decoding procedure while expanding the Transformer decoding sublayer.

Guo J.; Liu J.; Liu X.; Li L.,Summarizing source code through heterogeneous feature fusion and extraction,"Code summarization, which seeks to automatically produce a succinct natural-language description to summarize the functionality of source code, plays an essential role in maintaining the software. Currently, plentiful approaches have been proposed to first encode the source code based on its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then decode it into a textual summary. However, most existing works interpret the AST-based syntax structure as a homogeneous graph, without discriminating the different relations between graph nodes (e.g., the parent–child and sibling relations) in a heterogeneous way. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes HETCOS to extract the syntactic and sequential features of source code by exploring its inherent heterogeneity for code summarization. Specifically, we first build a Heterogeneous Code Graph (HCG) that fuses the syntax structure and code sequence with eight types of edges/relations designed between graph nodes. Moreover, we present a heterogeneous graph neural network for capturing the diverse relations in HCG. The represented HCG is then fed into a Transformer decoder, followed by a multi-head attention-based copying mechanism to support high-quality summary generation.

Recent studies demonstrate that the quality of generated summaries can be improved by using additional code representations beyond token sequences. The majority of contemporary approaches mainly focus on extracting code syntactic and structural information from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). However, from the view of macro-structures, it is challenging to identify and capture semantically meaningful features due to fine-grained syntactic nodes involved in ASTs. To fill this gap, we investigate how to learn more code semantics and control flow features from the perspective of code statements. Accordingly, we propose a novel model entitled CoSS for code summarization. CoSS adopts a Transformer-based encoder and a graph attention network-based encoder to capture token-level and statement-level semantics from code token sequence and control flow graph, respectively. Then, after receiving two-level embeddings from encoders, a joint decoder with a multi-head attention mechanism predicts output sequences verbatim. Performance evaluations on Java, Python, and Solidity datasets validate that CoSS outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) neural code summarization models in effectiveness and is competitive in execution efficiency.

SSCS is designed upon a structure-induced transformer with three main novel improvements. SSCS captures the structural information in a multi-scale aspect with an adapted fusion strategy and adopts a hierarchical encoding strategy to capture the textual information from the perspective of the document.

Currently, several structural neural networks have been exploited to preserve the syntax structure of source code based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs).

To mitigate this problem, we present a prototype tool titled PyScribe, which extends the Transformer model to a new encoder-decoder-based framework. Particularly, the triplet position is designed and integrated into the node-level and edge-level structural features of AST for producing Python code comments automatically. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, makes the first effort to model the edges of AST as an explicit component for improved code representation. By specifying triplet positions for each node and edge, the overall structural information can be well preserved in the learning process. Moreover, the captured node and edge features go through a two-stage decoding process to yield higher qualified comments. To evaluate the effectiveness of PyScribe, we resort to a large dataset of code-comment pairs by mining Jupyter Notebooks from GitHub, for which we have made it publicly available to support further studies.

Li J.; Wang X.; Lyu C.,ACAGNN: Source Code Representation Based on Fine-Grained Multi-view Program Features,"Existing program comprehension models represent a single code feature and coarse code granularity. They tend to consider the shal- low features of source code (e.g., method names, characters, etc.) and ignore the structured features of source code such as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG), and Application Programming Interface Dependency Graph (ADG), resulting in an incomplete representation of the source code. Although there are approaches to model ASTs, ASTs are efficient in representing code structure information. They have shortcomings in capturing the calling relationships of methods in the code for the entire class library, which does not allow the model to represent the global program accurately. To address these issues, we propose a multi-view source code representation model called ACAGNN, which uses a designed matching mechanism to learn multi-view code structure representation at the node-level and apply it to downstream code classification tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161117660&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-99-2385-4_36&partnerID=40&md5=06b6e73732a56c7c7766badf6fe78300,Communications in Computer and Information Science,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

Lu X.; Niu J.,Enhancing source code summarization from structure and semantics,"Source code summarization aims to generate concise and high-quality natural language descriptions for code snippets. High-quality code summaries can help developers better understand source codes. Researchers have made great efforts to generate more accurate summaries; however, due to the lack of preservation of source code structure and semantics, previous approaches have struggled to generate summaries that accurately describe the functionality or other major characteristics of codes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Code Structure and Semantic Fusion (CSSF) for automatically generating summaries for source code. CSSF can utilize both the structural and semantic information of source codes. To achieve this, we extract the overall structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) by expanding the AST and using a heterogeneous graph attention network. Furthermore, we use an additional sequence model to obtain the semantic information of the code fragment. Finally, we fuse the two kinds of information through a novel modality fusion method.

Kuang L.; Zhou C.; Yang X.,Code comment generation based on graph neural network enhanced transformer model for code understanding in open-source software ecosystems,"In open-source software ecosystems, the scale of source code is getting larger and larger, and developers often use various methods (good code comments or method names, etc.) to make the code easier to read and understand. However, high-quality code comments or method names are often unavailable due to tight project schedules or other reasons in open-source software ecosystems such as Github. Therefore, in this work, we try to use deep learning models to generate appropriate code comments or method names to help software development and maintenance, which requires a non-trivial understanding of the code. Therefore, we propose a Graph neural network enhanced Transformer model (GTrans for short) to learn code representation to understand code better. Specifically, GTrans learns code representation from code sequences and graphs. We use a Transformer encoder to capture the global representation from code sequence and a graph neural network (GNN) encoder to focus on the local details in the code graph, and then use a decoder to combine both global and local representations by attention mechanism. We use three public datasets collected from GitHub to evaluate our model. In an extensive evaluation, we show that GTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art models up to 3.8% increase in METEOR metrics on code comment generation and outperforms the state-of-the-art models by margins of 5.8%–9.4% in ROUGE metrics on method name generation after some adjustments on the structure.

Kuang L.; Ge F.; Zhang L.,Suggesting method names based on graph neural network with salient information modelling,"Descriptive method names have a great impact on improving program readability and facilitating software maintenance. Recently, due to high similarity between the task of method naming and text summarization, large amount of research based on natural language processing has been conducted to generate method names. However, method names are much shorter compared to long source code sequences. The salient information of the whole code snippet account for an relatively small part. Additionally, unlike natural language, source code has complicated structure information. Thus, modelling the salient information from highly structured input presents a great challenge. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based model with a novel salient information selection layer. Specifically, to comprehensively encode the tokens of the source code, we employ a GNN-based encoder, which can be directly applied to the code graph to ensure that the syntactic information of code structure and semantic information of code sequence can be modelled sufficiently. To effectively discriminate the salient information, we introduce an information selection layer which contains two parts: a global filter gate used to filter irrelevant information, and a semantic-aware convolutional layer used to focus on the semantic information contained in code sequence. To improve the precision of the copy mechanism when decoding, we introduce a salient feature enhanced attention mechanism to facilitate the accuracy of copying tokens from input.

Wu B.; Liang B.; Zhang X.,Turn tree into graph: Automatic code review via simplified AST driven graph convolutional network,"Automatic code review (ACR), which can relieve the costs of manual inspection, is an indispensable and essential task in software engineering. To deal with ACR, existing work is to serialize the abstract syntax tree (AST). However, making sense of the whole AST with sequence encoding approach is a daunting task, mostly due to some redundant nodes in AST hinder the transmission of node information. Not to mention that the serialized representation is inadequate to grasp the information of tree structure in AST. In this paper, we first present a new large-scale Apache Automatic Code Review (AACR) dataset for ACR task since there is still no publicly available dataset in this task. The release of this dataset would push forward the research in this field. Based on it, we propose a novel Simplified AST based Graph Convolutional Network (SimAST-GCN) to deal with ACR task. Concretely, to improve the efficiency of node information dissemination, we first simplify the AST of code by deleting the redundant nodes that do not contain connection attributes, and thus deriving a Simplified AST. Then, we construct a relation graph for each code based on the Simplified AST to properly embody the relations among code fragments of the tree structure into the graph. Subsequently, in the light of the merit of graph structure, we explore a graph convolution networks architecture that follows an attention mechanism to leverage the crucial implications of code fragments to derive code representations. Finally, we exploit a simple but effective subtraction operation in the representations between the original and revised code, enabling the revised difference to be preferably learned for deciding the results of ACR.

Qu Z.; Hu Y.; Zeng J.; Cai B.; Yang S.,Method Name Generation Based on Code Structure Guidance,"The proper names of software engineering functions and methods can greatly assist developers in understanding and maintaining the code. Most researchers convert the method name generation task into the text summarization task. They take the token sequence and the abstract syntax tree (AST) of source code as input, and generate method names with a decoder. However, most proposed models learn semantic and structural features of the source code separately, resulting in poor performance in the method name generation task. Actually, each token in source code must have a corresponding node in its AST. Inspired by this observation, we propose SGMNG, a structure-guided method name generation model that learns the representation of two combined features. Additionally, we build a code graph called code relation graph (CRG) to describe the code structure clearly. CRG retains the structure of the AST of source code and contains data flows and control flows. SGMNG captures the semantic features of the code by encoding the token sequence and captures the structural features of the code by encoding the CRG. Then, SGMNG matches tokens in the sequence and nodes in the CRG to construct the combination of two features.

One key challenge keeping these approaches from being practical lies in the lacking of retaining the semantic structure of source code, which has unfortunately been overlooked by the state-of-the-art methods. Existing approaches resort to representing the syntax structure of code by modeling the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). However, the hierarchical structures of ASTs have not been well explored.

In this paper, we propose HELoC, a hierarchical contrastive learning model for source code representation. To effectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the network to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships between nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation vectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the embedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between code snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel GNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed, which enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while capturing its overall structure.

This puts the code search and comprehension in difficulty, and increases the burden of maintenance for software building upon these codes. As summarizing code is beneficial yet it is very expensive for manual operation, in this paper, we elaborate an automatic and effective code summarization paradigm to address this laborious challenge. We represent a given code snippet as an abstract syntax tree (AST), and generate a set of compositional root-to-leaf paths to make the AST accessible regarding code context and structure in a less complex yet expressive way. Accordingly, we design a tree-based transformer model, called TreeXFMR, on these paths to summarize source code in a hierarchical attention operation. This yields two advantages on code representation learning: (1) attention mechanisms at token-and path-level attend the semantics and interactions of source code from different aspects; (2) bi-level positional encodings introduced reveal the intra- and inter-path structure of AST and improve the unambiguity of the representations. During decoding, TreeXFMR attends such learned representations to produce each output of natural language word. We further pre-train the transformer to achieve faster and better training convergence results.

The main purpose of the code summarization is to help software developers understand the code and save their precious time. However, since programming languages are highly structured, it is challenging to generate high-quality code summaries. For this reason, this paper proposes a new approach named CCHG to automatically generate code comments. Compared to recent models that use additional information such as Abstract Syntax Trees as input, our proposed method only uses the most original code as input. We believe that programming languages are the same as natural languages. Each line of code is equivalent to a sentence, representing an independent meaning. Therefore, we split the entire code snippet into several sentence-level code. Coupled with token-level code, there are two types of code that need to be processed. So we propose heterogeneous graph networks to process the sentence-level and token-level code.

Zhang F.; Chen B.; Li R.; Peng X.,A hybrid code representation learning approach for predicting method names,"Program semantic properties such as class names, method names, and variable names and types play an important role in software development and maintenance. Method names are of particular importance because they provide the cornerstone of abstraction for developers to communicate with each other for various purposes (e.g., code review and program comprehension). Existing method name prediction approaches often represent code as lexical tokens or syntactical AST (abstract syntax tree) paths, making them difficult to learn code semantics and hindering their effectiveness in predicting method names. Initial attempts have been made to represent code as execution traces to capture code semantics, but suffer scalability in collecting execution traces. In this paper, we propose a hybrid code representation learning approach, named METH2SEQ, to encode a method as a sequence of distributed vectors. METH2SEQ represents a method as (1) a bag of paths on the program dependence graph, (2) a sequence of typed intermediate representation statements and (3) a sentence of natural language comment, to scalably capture code semantics. The learned sequence of vectors of a method is fed to a decoder model to predict method names.

Towards this end, researchers have proposed some approaches to automatically recommend candidate methods for renaming. To further improve the performance of existing techniques, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that fully leverages historical code changes and overlapping relationships among code entities to identify renaming opportunities for methods. Specifically, we first embed methods into vectors and incorporate overlapping relationships among code entities by using different attention heads in a deep learning network. Then, we apply these obtained vectors to train a classifier to predict potential renaming opportunities for methods.

Ge F.; Kuang L.,Keywords Guided Method Name Generation,"High quality method names are descriptive and readable, which are helpful for code development and maintenance. The majority of recent research suggest method names based on the text summarization approach.

However, the tokens composing the method name are closely related to the entity name within its method implementation. Actually, high proportions of the tokens in method name can be found in its corresponding method implementation, which makes it possible for incorporating these common shared token information to improve the performance of method naming task. Inspired by this key observation, we propose a two-stage keywords guided method name generation approach to suggest method names. Specifically, we decompose the method naming task into two subtasks, including keywords extraction task and method name generation task. For the keywords extraction task, we apply a graph neural network based model to extract the keywords from source code.

Code summarization is rapidly expanding, especially as the research takes great advantage of advances in neural networks and artificial intelligence technologies. Some mainstream methods input the structural information (abstract syntax tree (AST)) of the source code into the language model to generate relatively satisfactory comments. However, existing methods can not capture code's long dependencies from AST for effective code summarization. In this paper, we provide a novel way to generate code summaries by combining a graph-based neural network and a Transformer-XL network. We utilize the graph-based neural network to better capture the structure information of AST, and the Transformer-XL network to learn important tokens in the AST and alleviate the problem of long dependency. We evaluate our technique on the standard Java dataset. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of our model is remarkable.

Zeng J.; Zhang T.; Xu Z.,DG-Trans: Automatic Code Summarization via Dynamic Graph Attention-based Transformer,"Automatic code summarization is an important topic in the software engineering field, which aims to automatically generate the description for the source code. Based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), most existing methods apply them to Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to achieve code summarization. However, these methods face two major challenges: 1) they can only capture limited structural information of the source code; 2) they did not effectively solve Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems by reducing vocabulary size. In order to resolve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel code summarization model named Dynamic Graph attention-based Transformer (DG-Trans for short), which effectively captures abundant information of the code subword sequence and utilizes the fusion of dynamic graph attention mechanism and Transformer. Extensive experiments show that DG-Trans is able to outperform state-of-the-art models (such as Ast-Attendgru, Transformer, and CodeGNN) by averagely increasing 8.39% and 8.86% on BLEU scores and ROUGUE-L, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.",Conference paper,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146199326&doi=10.1109%2fQRS54544.2021.00088&partnerID=40&md5=1d7eda6868c42c29189049d9fd3a7224,"IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security, QRS",Yes,Include,I.1,"",Include,

Lu M.; Liu Y.; Li H.; Tan D.; He X.; Bi W.; Li W.,Hyperbolic function embedding: Learning hierarchical representation for functions of source code in hyperbolic space,"Recently, source code mining has received increasing attention due to the rapid increase of open-sourced code repositories and the tremendous values implied in this large dataset, which can help us understand the organization of functions or classes in different software and analyze the impact of these organized patterns on the software behaviors. Hence, learning an effective representation model for the functions of source code, from a modern view, is a crucial problem. Considering the inherent hierarchy of functions, we propose a novel hyperbolic function embedding (HFE) method, which can learn a distributed and hierarchical representation for each function via the Poincaré ball model. To achieve this, a function call graph (FCG) is first constructed to model the call relationship among functions. To verify the underlying geometry of FCG, the Ricci curvature model is used. Finally, an HFE model is built to learn the representations that can capture the latent hierarchy of functions in the hyperbolic space, instead of the Euclidean space, which are usually used in those state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HFE is more compact in terms of lower dimensionality than the existing graph embedding methods. Thus, HFE is more effective in terms of computation and storage. To experimentally evaluate the performance of HFE, two application scenarios, namely, function classification and link prediction, have been applied. HFE achieves up to 7.6% performance improvement compared to the chosen state-of-the-art methods, namely, Node2vec and Struc2vec. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061872138&doi=10.3390%2fsym11020254&partnerID=40&md5=6c5c53d9c208b17eb6077ad1121a8f2b,Symmetry,Yes,Include,I1.2,"","",""

Firstly, the abstract syntax tree is extracted from the code, and then the abstract syntax tree of the code is transformed into a graph representation using control flow statements in the data stream, which is trained by a graph convolutional neural network, and the obtained training results are fused with the original sequence representation to finally obtain a source code representation that incorporates the semantic information of the code context and structural information.

Yang G.; Jin T.; Dou L.,Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification,"Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural network (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order correlations that already exist between nodes in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose to represent AST as a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) and process the graph by heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs.

Long T.; Xie Y.; Chen X.; Zhang W.; Cao Q.; Yu Y.,Multi-View Graph Representation for Programming Language Processing: An Investigation into Algorithm Detection,"Program representation, which aims at converting program source code into vectors with automatically extracted features, is a fundamental problem in programming language processing (PLP). Recent work tries to represent programs with neural networks based on source code structures. However, such methods often focus on the syntax and consider only one single perspective of programs, limiting the representation power of models. This paper proposes a multi-view graph (MVG) program representation method. MVG pays more attention to code semantics and simultaneously includes both data flow and control flow as multiple views. These views are then combined and processed by a graph neural network (GNN) to obtain a comprehensive program representation that covers various aspects. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed MVG approach in the context of algorithm detection, an important and challenging subfield of PLP. Specifically, we use a public dataset POJ-104 and also construct a new challenging dataset ALG-109 to test our method.

Zhang K.; Wang W.; Zhang H.; Li G.; Jin Z.,Learning to Represent Programs with Heterogeneous Graphs,"Code representation, which transforms programs into vectors with semantics, is essential for source code processing. We have witnessed the effectiveness of incorporating structural information (i.e., graph) into code representations in recent years. Specifically, the abstract syntax tree (AST) and the AST-augmented graph of the program contain much structural and semantic information, and most existing studies apply them for code representation. The graph adopted by existing approaches is homogeneous, i.e., it discards the type information of the edges and the nodes lying within AST. That may cause plausible obstruction to the representation model. In this paper, we propose to leverage the type information in the graph for code representation. To be specific, we propose the heterogeneous program graph (HPG), which provides the types of the nodes and the edges explicitly. Furthermore, we employ the heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) architecture to generate representations based on HPG, considering the type of information during processing. With the additional types in HPG, our approach can capture complex structural information, produce accurate and delicate representations, and finally perform well on certain tasks. Our in-depth evaluations upon four classic datasets for two typical tasks (i.e., method name prediction and code classification) demonstrate that the heterogeneous types in HPG benefit the representation models.

Wen X.-C.; Chen Y.; Gao C.; Zhang H.; Zhang J.M.; Liao Q.,Vulnerability Detection with Graph Simplification and Enhanced Graph Representation Learning,"Prior studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) in automated software vulnerability detection. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in learning the graph representations of source code and are commonly adopted by existing DL-based vulnerability detection methods. However, the existing methods are still limited by the fact that GNNs are essentially difficult to handle the connections between long-distance nodes in a code structure graph. Besides, they do not well exploit the multiple types of edges in a code structure graph (such as edges representing data flow and control flow). Consequently, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, the existing GNN-based methods tend to fail to capture global information (i.e., long-range dependencies among nodes) of code graphs. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel vulnerability detection framework with grAph siMplification and enhanced graph rePresentation LEarning, named AMPLE. AMPLE mainly contains two parts: 1) graph simplification, which aims at reducing the distances between nodes by shrinking the node sizes of code structure graphs; 2) enhanced graph representation learning, which involves one edge-aware graph convolutional network module for fusing heterogeneous edge information into node representations and one kernel-scaled representation module for well capturing the relations between distant graph nodes. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that AMPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 0.39%-35.32% and 7.64%-199.81% with respect to the accuracy and F1 score metrics, respectively.

However, it is unclear whether these methods are suitable for GNNs and support the task of vulnerability discovery. In this paper we present a framework for evaluating explanation methods on GNNs. We develop a set of criteria for comparing graph explanations and linking them to properties of source code. Based on these criteria, we conduct an experimental study of nine regular and three graph-specific explanation methods. Our study demonstrates that explaining GNNs is a non-Trivial task and all evaluation criteria play a role in assessing their efficacy.

Wang K.; Yan M.; Zhang H.; Hu H.,Unified Abstract Syntax Tree Representation Learning for Cross-Language Program Classification,"Program classification can be regarded as a high-level abstraction of code, laying a foundation for various tasks related to source code comprehension, and has a very wide range of applications in the field of software engineering, such as code clone detection, code smell classification, defects classification, etc. The cross-language program classification can realize code transfer in different programming languages, and can also promote cross-language code reuse, thereby helping developers to write code quickly and reduce the development time of code transfer. Most of the existing studies focus on the semantic learning of the code, whilst few studies are devoted to cross-language tasks. The main challenge of cross-language program classification is how to extract semantic features of different programming languages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core idea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST representation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST structure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a mechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between different programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language program classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files of five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the cross-language program classification task.

Because student programs are relatively small, which makes them contain less information. Consequently, it is necessary to mine as much information as possible in student programs.

Recent studies show that the information extracted from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) is conducive to code representation learning. However, existing approaches fail to fully capture the rich information in ASTs due to the large size/depth of ASTs. In this paper, we propose a novel model CoCoAST that hierarchically splits and reconstructs ASTs to comprehensively capture the syntactic and semantic information of code without the loss of AST structural information. First, we hierarchically split a large AST into a set of subtrees and utilize a recursive neural network to encode the subtrees.

Traditionally, designers of machine learning models have relied predominantly either on Structure or Context. We propose a new model, which jointly learns on Context and Structure of source code. In contrast to previous approaches, our model uses only language-agnostic features, i.e., source code and features that can be computed directly from the AST. Besides obtaining state-of-the-art on monolingual code summarization on all five programming languages considered in this work, we propose the first multilingual code summarization model. We show that jointly training on non-parallel data from multiple programming languages improves results on all individual languages, where the strongest gains are on low-resource languages. Remarkably, multilingual training only from Context does not lead to the same improvements, highlighting the benefits of combining Structure and Context for representation learning on code. © 2021 ICLR 2021 - 9th International Conference on Learning Representations.

Due to the advantages of NMT model's strong generalization ability and less manual in-tervention, NMT-based methods perform well in APR. However, previous NMT-based APR approaches regard a code snippet as a sequence of tokens, which ignores the inherent structure of code. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end approach with Graph-to-Sequence learning, GrasP, to generate patches for buggy methods. To better represent the buggy method, we use a graph based on abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the source code. In order to learn complex graph representation, we introduce the attention-based encoder-decoder model for graph-to-sequence learning.

This distributed embedding is obtained by combining representation learning methods with flow information to capture the syntax as well as the semantics of the input programs. As our infrastructure is based on the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the source code, obtained embeddings are both language and machine independent. The entities of the IR are modeled as relationships, and their representations are learned to form a seed embedding vocabulary. Using this infrastructure, we propose two incremental encodings: Symbolic and Flow-Aware. Symbolic encodings are obtained from the seed embedding vocabulary, and Flow-Aware encodings are obtained by augmenting the Symbolic encodings with the flow information. We show the effectiveness of our methodology on two optimization tasks (Heterogeneous device mapping and Thread coarsening). Our way of representing the programs enables us to use non-sequential models resulting in orders of magnitude of faster training time. Both the encodings generated by IR2VEC outperform the existing methods in both the tasks, even while using simple machine learning models. In particular, our results improve or match the state-of-the-art speedup in 11/14 benchmark-suites in the device mapping task across two platforms and 53/68 benchmarks in the thread coarsening task across four different platforms.

Cvitkovic M.; Singh B.; Anandkumar A.,Open vocabulary learning on source code with a graph-structured cache,"Machine learning models that take computer program source code as input typically use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. However, a major challenge is that code is written using an open, rapidly changing vocabulary due to, e.g., the coinage of new variable and method names. Reasoning over such a vocabulary is not something for which most NLP methods are designed. We introduce a Graph-Structured Cache to address this problem; this cache contains a node for each new word the model encounters with edges connecting each word to its occurrences in the code. We find that combining this graph-structured cache strategy with recent Graph-Neural-Network-based models for supervised learning on code improves the models' performance on a code completion task and a variable naming task - with over 100% relative improvement on the latter - at the cost of a moderate increase in computation time. © 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2019.

Du Y.; Yu Z.,Pre-training Code Representation with Semantic Flow Graph for Effective Bug Localization,"Enlightened by the big success of pre-training in natural language processing, pre-trained models for programming languages have been widely used to promote code intelligence in recent years. In particular, BERT has been used for bug localization tasks and impressive results have been obtained. However, these BERT-based bug localization techniques suffer from two issues. First, the pre-trained BERT model on source code does not adequately capture the deep semantics of program code. Second, the overall bug localization models neglect the necessity of large-scale negative samples in contrastive learning for representations of changesets and ignore the lexical similarity between bug reports and changesets during similarity estimation. We address these two issues by 1) proposing a novel directed, multiple-label code graph representation named Semantic Flow Graph (SFG), which compactly and adequately captures code semantics, 2) designing and training SemanticCodeBERT based on SFG, and 3) designing a novel Hierarchical Momentum Contrastive Bug Localization technique (HMCBL).

By the remarkable results, CodePTMs are seen as a promising direction in both academia and industry. While a number of CodePTMs have been proposed, they are often not directly comparable because they differ in experimental setups such as pretraining dataset, model size, evaluation tasks, and datasets.

Then, under the standardized setup, we re-pretrain CodePTMs using the same model architecture, input modalities, and pretraining tasks, as they declared and fine-tune each model on each evaluation SE task for evaluating.

Li Y.; Wang S.; Nguyen T.N.,Contextuality of Code Representation Learning,"Advanced machine learning models (ML) have been successfully leveraged in several software engineering (SE) applications. The existing SE techniques have used the embedding models ranging from static to contextualized ones to build the vectors for program units. The contextualized vectors address a phenomenon in natural language texts called polysemy, which is the coexistence of different meanings of a word/phrase. However, due to different nature, program units exhibit the nature of mixed polysemy. Some code tokens and statements exhibit polysemy while other tokens (e.g., keywords, separators, and operators) and statements maintain the same meaning in different contexts. A natural question is whether static or contextualized embeddings fit better with the nature of mixed polysemy in source code. The answer to this question is helpful for the SE researchers in selecting the right embedding model. We conducted experiments on 12 popular sequence-/tree-/graph-based embedding models and on the samples of a dataset of 10,222 Java projects with +14M methods. We present several contextuality evaluation metrics adapted from natural-language texts to code structures to evaluate the embeddings from those models. Among several findings, we found that the models with higher contextuality help a bug detection model perform better than the static ones. Neither static nor contextualized embedding models fit well with the mixed polysemy nature of source code. Thus, we develop Hycode, a hybrid embedding model that fits better with the nature of mixed polysemy in source code.  © 2023 IEEE.",Conference paper,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179003533&doi=10.1109%2fASE56229.2023.00029&partnerID=40&md5=a7534a657318d2c3d46776b193ca0886,"Proceedings - 2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2023",Yes,Exclude,"E2.2,E1.8)","",,Exclude

Recently, many works have tried to improve the performance of source code representation from various perspectives, e.g., introducing the structural information of programs into latent representation. However, when dealing with rapidly expanded unlabeled cross-language source code datasets from the Internet, there are still two issues. Firstly, deep learning models for many code-specific tasks still suffer from the lack of high-quality labels. Secondly, the structural differences among programming languages make it more difficult to process multiple languages in a single neural architecture.To address these issues, in this article, we propose a novel Cross-language Code representation with a large-scale pre-Training (XCode) method. Concretely, we propose to use several abstract syntax trees and ELMo-enhanced variational autoencoders to obtain multiple pre-Trained source code language models trained on about 1.5 million code snippets. To fully utilize the knowledge across programming languages, we further propose a Shared Encoder-Decoder (SED) architecture which uses the multi-Teacher single-student method to transfer knowledge from the aforementioned pre-Trained models to the distilled SED. The pre-Trained models and SED will cooperate to better represent the source code. For evaluation, we examine our approach on three typical downstream cross-language tasks, i.e., source code translation, code clone detection, and code-To-code search, on a real-world dataset composed of programming exercises with multiple solutions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on cross-language code representations. Meanwhile, our approach performs significantly better than several code representation baselines on different downstream tasks in terms of multiple automatic evaluation metrics.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A first step generates abstract execution sequences (AES) from both predefined test cases and abstract syntax trees (AST) of the submitted programs.

With the massive amount of available programs such as (on GitHub or Stack Overflow), identifying and localizing the precise code is critical for the software developers. In addition, Deep learning has recently been widely applied to different code-related scenarios, e.g., vulnerability detection, source code summarization. However, automated deep code search is still challenging since it requires a high-level semantic mapping between code and natural language queries. Most existing deep learning-based approaches for code search rely on the sequential text i.e., feeding the program and the query as a flat sequence of tokens to learn the program semantics while the structural information is not fully considered. Furthermore, the widely adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved their effectiveness in learning program semantics, however, they also suffer the problem of capturing the global dependencies in the constructed graph, which limits the model learning capacity. To address these challenges, in this paper, we design a novel neural network framework, named GraphSearchNet, to enable an effective and accurate source code search by jointly learning the rich semantics of both source code and natural language queries. Specifically, we propose to construct graphs for the source code and queries with bidirectional GGNN (BiGGNN) to capture the local structural information of the source code and queries. Furthermore, we enhance BiGGNN by utilizing the multi-head attention module to supplement the global dependencies that BiGGNN missed to improve the model learning capacity.

With the availability of large and rapidly growing source code repositories covering various languages, multilingual code search can leverage more training data to learn complementary information across languages. Contrastive learning can naturally understand the similarity between functionally equivalent code across different languages by narrowing the distance between objects with the same function while keeping dissimilar objects further apart. Some works exist addressing monolingual code search problems with contrastive learning, however, they mainly exploit every specific programming language's textual semantics or syntactic structures for code representation. Due to the high diversity of different languages in terms of syntax, format, and structure, these methods limit the performance of contrastive learning in multilingual training. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified semantic graph representation approach toward multilingual code search called MulCS. Specifically, we first design a general semantic graph construction strategy across different languages by Intermediate Representation (IR).

Cai B.; Yu Y.; Hu Y.,CSSAM: Code Search via Attention Matching of Code Semantics and Structures,"Code search greatly improves developers' coding efficiency by retrieving reusable code segments with natural language queries. Despite the continuous efforts in improving both the effectiveness and efficiency of code search, two issues remained unsolved. First, programming languages have inherent strong structural linkages, and feature mining of code as text form would omit the structural information contained inside it. Second, there is a potential semantic relationship between code and query, it is challenging to align code and text across sequences so that vectors are spatially consistent during similarity matching.To tackle both issues, in this paper, a code search model named CSSAM (Code Semantics and Structures Attention Matching) is proposed. By introducing semantic and structural matching mechanisms, CSSAM effectively extracts and fuses multidimensional code features. Specifically, the cross and co-attention layer was developed to facilitate high-latitude spatial alignment of code and query at the token level. By leveraging the residual interaction, a matching module is designed to preserve more code semantics and descriptive features, which enhances the relevance between the code and its corresponding query text. Besides, to improve the model's comprehension of the code's inherent structure, a code representation structure named CSRG (Code Semantic Representation Graph) is proposed for jointly representing abstract syntax tree nodes and the data flow of the codes. According to the experimental results on two publicly available datasets containing 475k and 330k code segments, CSSAM significantly outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving the highest SR@1/5/10, MRR, and NDCG@50 on both datasets, respectively.

The standard neural code quest approaches present source code and query in the form of text as independent embedding, then calculate the semantic similarity between them using vector distance (e.g., using cosine similarity).

Through converting the code graphs into lossless sequences, G2SC enables to address the problem of small graph learning using sequence feature learning and capture both the edges and nodes attribute information of code graphs. Thus, the effectiveness of code search can be greatly improved. In particular, G2SC first converts the code graph into a unique corresponding node sequence by a specific graph traversal strategy. Then, it gets a statement sequence by replacing each node with its corresponding statement. A set of carefully designed graph traversal strategies guarantee that the process is one-to-one and reversible. G2SC enables capturing rich semantic relationships (i.e., control flow, data flow, node/relationship properties) and provides learning model-friendly data transformation. It can be flexibly integrated with existing models to better utilize the code graphs. As a proof-of-concept application, we present two G2SC enabled models: GSMM (G2SC enabled multi-modal model) and GSCodeBERT (G2SC enabled CodeBERT model). Extensive experiment results on two real large-scale datasets demonstrate that GSMM and GSCodeBERT can greatly improve the state-of-the-art models MMAN and GraphCodeBERT by 92% and 22% on R@1, and 63% and 11.5% on MRR, respectively.  © 2022 ACM.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143074294&doi=10.1145%2f3540250.3549087&partnerID=40&md5=3fff757818bd06978797e83b1081d809,ESEC/FSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 30th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,
Zhao W.; Liu Y.,Utilizing Edge Attention in Graph-Based Code Search,"Code search refers to searching code snippets with specific functions in a large codebase according to natural language description. Classic code search approaches, using information retrieval technologies, fail to utilize code semantics and bring noisy and irrelevant. During the last recent years, there has been an ample increase in the number of deep learning-based approaches, which embeds lexical semantics into unified vectors to achieve higher-level mapping between natural language queries and source code. However, these approaches are struggling with how to mine and utilize deep code semantics. In this work, we study how to leverage deeper source code semantics in graph-based source code search, given graph-based representation is a promising way of capturing program and has rich explainability. We propose a novel code search approach called EAGCS (Edge Attention-based Graph Code Search), which is composed of a novel code graph representation method called APDG (Advanced Program Dependence Graph) and a graph neural network called EAGGNN (Edge Attention-based GGNN) which can learn the latent code semantics of APDG. Experiment results demonstrate that our model outperforms the GGNN-based search model and DeepCS.

Deng Z.; Xu L.; Liu C.; Yan M.; Xu Z.; Lei Y.,Fine-grained Co-Attentive Representation Learning for Semantic Code Search,"Code search aims to find code snippets from large-scale code repositories based on the developer's query intent. A significant challenge for code search is the semantic gap between programming language and natural language. Recent works have indicated that deep learning (DL) techniques can perform well by automatically learning the relationships between query and code. Among these DL-based approaches, the state-of-the-art model is TabCS, a two-stage attention-based model for code search. However, TabCS still has two limitations: semantic loss and semantic confusion. TabCS breaks the structural information of code into token-level words of abstract syntax tree (AST), which loses the sequential semantics between words in programming statements, and it uses a co-attention mechanism to build the semantic correlation of code-query after fusing all features, which may confuse the correlations between individual code features and query. In this paper, we propose a code search model named FcarCS (Fine-grained Co-Attentive Representation Learning Model for Semantic Code Search). FcarCS extracts code textual features (i.e., method name, API sequence, and tokens) and structural features that introduce a statement-level code structure. Unlike TabCS, FcarCS splits AST into a series of subtrees corresponding to code statements and treats each subtree as a whole to preserve sequential semantics between words in code statements. FcarCS constructs a new fine-grained co-attention mechanism to learn interdependent representations for each code feature and query, respectively, instead of performing one co-attention process for the fused code features like TabCS. Generally, this mechanism leverages row/column-wise CNN to enable our model to focus on the strongly correlated local information between code feature and Query. We train and evaluate FcarCS on an open Java dataset with 475k and 10k code/query pairs, respectively. Experimental results show that FcarCS achieves an MRR of 0.613, outperforming three state-of-the-art models DeepCS, UNIF, and TabCS, by 117.38%, 16.76%, and 12.68%, respectively. We also performed a user study for each model with 50 real-world queries, and the results show that FcarCS returned code snippets that are more relevant than the baseline models.  © 2022 IEEE.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135793766&doi=10.1109%2fSANER53432.2022.00055&partnerID=40&md5=1795969acdea1df7b7ad47fcfce02acd,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering, SANER 2022",Yes,Include,E1.1,"",,

To support code reuse, early code search models leverage information retrieval (IR) techniques to index a large-scale code corpus and return relevant code according to developers' search query. However, IR-based models fail to capture the semantics in code and query. To tackle this issue, developers applied deep learning (DL) techniques to code search models. However, these models either are too complex to determine an effective method efficiently or learning for semantic correlation between code and query inadequately.To bridge the semantic gap between code and query effectively and efficiently, we propose a code search model TabCS (Two-stage Attention-Based model for Code Search) in this study. TabCS extracts code and query information from the code textual features (i.e., method name, API sequence, and tokens), the code structural feature (i.e., abstract syntax tree), and the query feature (i.e., tokens). TabCS performs a two-stage attention net-work structure. The first stage leverages attention mechanisms to extract semantics from code and query considering their semantic gap. The second stage leverages a co-attention mechanism to capture their semantic correlation and learn better code/query representation. We evaluate the performance of TabCS on two existing large-scale datasets with 485k and 542k code snippets, respectively.

Recent work mainly uses natural language processing techniques to process both query texts (i.e., human natural language) and code snippets (i.e., machine programming language), however, neglecting the deep structured features of query texts and source codes, both of which contain rich semantic information. In this article, we propose an end-to-end deep graph matching and searching (DGMS) model based on graph neural networks for the task of semantic code retrieval. To this end, we first represent both natural language query texts and programming language code snippets with the unified graph-structured data, and then use the proposed graph matching and searching model to retrieve the best matching code snippet. In particular, DGMS not only captures more structural information for individual query texts or code snippets, but also learns the fine-grained similarity between them by cross-attention based semantic matching operations. We evaluate the proposed DGMS model on two public code retrieval datasets with two representative programming languages (i.e., Java and Python).

Despite the existing efforts in improving the effectiveness of code retrieval, there are still two main issues hindering them from being used to accurately retrieve satisfiable code fragments from large-scale repositories when answering complicated queries. First, the existing approaches only consider shallow features of source code such as method names and code tokens, but ignoring structured features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and control-flow graphs (CFGs) of source code, which contains rich and well-defined semantics of source code. Second, although the deep learning-based approach performs well on the representation of source code, it lacks the explainability, making it hard to interpret the retrieval results and almost impossible to understand which features of source code contribute more to the final results. To tackle the two aforementioned issues, this paper proposes MMAN, a novel Multi-Modal Attention Network for semantic source code retrieval. A comprehensive multi-modal representation is developed for representing unstructured and structured features of source code, with one LSTM for the sequential tokens of code, a Tree-LSTM for the AST of code and a GGNN (Gated Graph Neural Network) for the CFG of code. Furthermore, a multi-modal attention fusion layer is applied to assign weights to different parts of each modality of source code and then integrate them into a single hybrid representation.

Mehrotra N.; Sharma A.; Jindal A.; Purandare R.,Improving Cross-Language Code Clone Detection via Code Representation Learning and Graph Neural Networks,"Code clone detection is an important aspect of software development and maintenance. The extensive research in this domain has helped reduce the complexity and increase the robustness of source code, thereby assisting bug detection tools. However, the majority of the clone detection literature is confined to a single language. With the increasing prevalence of cross-platform applications, functionality replication across multiple languages is common, resulting in code fragments having similar functionality but belonging to different languages. Since such clones are syntactically unrelated, single language clone detection tools are not applicable in their case. In this article, we propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based tool Rubhus, capable of detecting clones across different programming languages. Rubhus uses the control and data flow enriched abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of code fragments to leverage their syntactic and structural information and then applies graph neural networks (GNNs) to extract this information for the task of clone detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system through experiments conducted over datasets consisting of Java, C, and Python programs and evaluate its performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score.

However, existing approaches suffer from two major drawbacks: (a) insufficient utilization of code representations, leading to inefficient semantics learning, and (b) low efficiency of clone detection, resulting in massive detection time. Therefore, we are motivated to propose an efficient semantics learning method while speeding up the detection process. Specifically, to address the first one, we adopt either CFG (Control Flow Graph) or PDG (Program Dependency Graph) as our initial code representation because of their rich semantic information. Further, we propose a novel graph-based code semantics learning method, which can capture critical information at token, statement, edge, and graph levels.

It can uniformly generate graph embeddings for code fragments and facilitate parallel detection of semantic clones, thus significantly boosting the speed of semantic clone detection.

Wang Y.; Ye Y.; Wu Y.; Zhang W.; Xue Y.; Liu Y.,Comparison and Evaluation of Clone Detection Techniques with Different Code Representations,"As one of bad smells in code, code clones may increase the cost of software maintenance and the risk of vulnerability propagation. In the past two decades, numerous clone detection technologies have been proposed. They can be divided into text-based, token-based, tree-based, and graph-based approaches according to their code representations. Different code representations abstract the code details from different perspectives. However, it is unclear which code representation is more effective in detecting code clones and how to combine different code representations to achieve ideal performance. In this paper, we present an empirical study to compare the clone detection ability of different code representations. Specifically, we reproduce 12 clone detection algorithms and divide them into different groups according to their code representations. After analyzing the empirical results, we find that token and tree representations can perform better than graph representation when detecting simple code clones. However, when the code complexity of a code pair increases, graph representation becomes more effective. To make our findings more practical, we perform manual analysis on open-source projects to seek a possible distribution of different clone types in the open-source community. Through the results, we observe that most clone pairs belong to simple code clones. Based on this observation, we discard heavyweight graph-based clone detection algorithms and conduct combination experiments to find out a suitable combination of token-based and tree-based approaches for achieving scalable and effective code clone detection. We develop the suitable combination into a tool called TACC and evaluate it with other state-of-the-art code clone detectors.

With the rapid development of deep neural network in program analysis, the state-of-the-art neural network-based function clone identification methods propose to represent functions as embeddings by graph neural network (GNN). However, such a novel representation of functions brings in two challenges. (1) The feature engineering that accurately maps the raw data of binary code to machine learning features is complicated. (2) A highly accurate embedding of functions requires a customized GNN to focus on the most critical features to identify binary code. To the best of our knowledge, currently, a comprehensive work that can overcome the above challenges is still missing. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype named as Focus, which is designed to accurately and efficiently identify similar functions. Specifically, inspired by natural language processing techniques which effectively learns text semantic across natural languages, Focus can learn representative semantic features of functions by a customized learning model. To address the second challenge, a multi-head attention mechanism can be employed to capture the critical features of a function. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Focus achieves high accuracy of function clone identification on a broad range of eight architectures. In particular, the identification performance (AUC value) of Focus is 97% and 99% for cross-platform and single-platform, respectively.

Hu Y.; Zou D.; Peng J.; Wu Y.; Shan J.; Jin H.,TreeCen: Building Tree Graph for Scalable Semantic Code Clone Detection,"Code clone detection is an important research problem that has attracted wide attention in software engineering. Many methods have been proposed for detecting code clone, among which text-based and token-based approaches are scalable but lack consideration of code semantics, thus resulting in the inability to detect semantic code clones. Methods based on intermediate representations of codes can solve the problem of semantic code clone detection. However, graph-based methods are not practicable due to code compilation, and existing tree-based approaches are limited by the scale of trees for scalable code clone detection. In this paper, we propose TreeCen, a scalable tree-based code clone detector, which satisfies scalability while detecting semantic clones effectively. Given the source code of a method, we first extract its abstract syntax tree (AST) based on static analysis and transform it into a simple graph representation (i.e., tree graph) according to the node type, rather than using traditional heavyweight tree matching. We then treat the tree graph as a social network and adopt centrality analysis on each node to maintain the tree details. By this, the original complex tree can be converted into a 72-dimensional vector while containing comprehensive structural information of the AST. Finally, these vectors are fed into a machine learning model to train a detector and use it to find code clones. We conduct comparative evaluations on effectiveness and scalability. The experimental results show that TreeCen maintains the best performance of the other six state-of-the-art methods (i.e., SourcererCC, RtvNN, DeepSim, SCDetector, Deckard, and ASTNN) with F1 scores of 0.99 and 0.95 on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam datasets, respectively.

Deep learning has been applied in some research and achieved better performance than traditional methods. To adapt to more application scenarios and improve the detection efficiency, this paper proposes a low-complex code clone detection with the graph- based neural network. As the input of the neural network, code features are represented by abstract syntax trees (ASTs), in which the redundant edges are removed. The operation of pruning avoids interference in the message passing of the network and reduces the size of the graph. Then, the graph pairs for the code clone detection are sent into the message passing neural networks (MPNN). In addition, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used to learn the information between graph pairs to avoid the operation of Graph mapping. After multiple iterations, the attention mechanism is used to read out the graph vector, and the cosine similarity is calculated on the graph vector to obtain the code similarity. Through the experiments on two datasets, the results show that the proposed clone detection scheme removes about 20 % of the redundant edges and reduces 25 % of model weights, 16% of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs).

To alleviate the threat, it is essential to accurately and efficiently make the decisions of change propagation between clone instances. Based on an exploratory study on clone change propagation with five famous open-source projects, we find that a clone class can have both propagation-required changes and propagation-free changes and thus fine-grained change propagation decision is required. Based on the findings, we propose a graph-based deep learning approach to predict the change propagation requirements of clone instances. We develop a graph representation, named Fused Clone Program Dependency Graph (FC-PDG), to capture the textual and structural code contexts of a pair of clone instances along with the changes on one of them. Based on the representation, we design a deep learning model that uses a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to predict the change propagation requirement.

In AST, the semantic of nodes is obviously hierarchical, and the importance of nodes is quite different to determine whether the two code fragments are cloned or not. However, some approaches do not fully consider the hierarchical structure information of source code. Some approaches ignore the different importance of nodes when generating the features of source code. Thirdly, when the tree is very large and deep, many approaches are vulnerable to the gradient vanishing problem during training. In order to properly address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical attentive graph neural network embedding model-HAG for the code clone detection. Firstly, the attention mechanism is applied on nodes in AST to distinguish the importance of different nodes during the model training. In addition, the HAG adopts graph convolutional network (GCN) to propagate the code message on AST graph and then exploits a hierarchical differential pooling GCN to sufficiently capture the code semantics at different structure level. To evaluate the effectiveness of HAG, we conducted extensive experiments on public clone dataset and compared it with seven state-of-the-art clone detection models. The experimental results demonstrate that the HAG achieves superior detection performance compared with baseline models. Especially, in the detection of moderately Type-3 or Type-4 clones, the HAG particularly outperforms baselines, indicating the strong detection capability of HAG for semantic clones. Apart from that, the impacts of the hierarchical pooling, attention mechanism and critical model parameters are systematically discussed. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Article,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108504823&doi=10.1142%2fS021819402150025X&partnerID=40&md5=3727ad1687104d345c750a459d003607,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,No Access,Exclude,,"","",""

Xu K.; Liu Y.,SCCD-GAN: An Enhanced Semantic Code Clone Detection Model Using GAN,"Code clone refers to a pair of semantically similar but syntactically similar or different code fragments that exist in code base. Excessive code clones in software system will cause a negative impact on system development and maintenance. In recent years, as deep learning has become a hot research area of machine learning, researchers have tried to apply deep learning techniques to code clone detection tasks. They have proposed a series of detection techniques using including unstructured (code in the form of sequential tokens) and structured (code in the form of abstract syntax trees and control-flow graphs) information to detect semantically similar but syntactically different code clone, which is the most difïîcult-to-detect clone type. However, although these methods have achieved an important improvement in the precision of semantic code clone detection, the corresponding false positive rate(FPR) is also at a very high level, making these methods unable to be effectively applied to real-world code bases. This paper proposed S C C D - G A N, an enhanced semantic code clone detection model which based on a graph representation form of programs and uses Graph Attention Network to measure the similarity of code pairs and achieved a lower detection F P R than existing methods. We built the graph representation of the code by expanding the control flow and data flow information to the original abstract syntax tree, and equipped with an attention mechanism to our model that focuses on the most important code parts and features which contribute much to the final detection precision.

Chen Z.,Semantic based Cross-Language Clone Related Bug Detection,"Code clones are widespread in software since programmers always reuse code to reduce programming effort. As programming languages are continuing to evolve and morph, code clones also widely exist across different languages for platform compatibility and adoption. Although code clones can improve development efficiency, they are prone to introducing bugs. Existing code clone detection technologies, however, mainly focused on single programming language or syntactical features of code. The syntax of different programming language are diverse because of syntax sugar, and many cloning pairs are semantic related instead of syntactic similar, such as Type 4 clones. To bridge the gap between syntax and semantic, and detect clone-related bugs more accurately, we explore an IR (Intermediate Representation) based method to represent code semantic representation information of multiple language code. We utilize graph neural network to learn code semantic representation. Through the semantic representation, we can detect more cross-language clone related bugs across multiple language.  © 2021 IEEE.",Conference paper,2021,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127493196&doi=10.1109%2fAINIT54228.2021.00101&partnerID=40&md5=6ced2448716044d6fed75c1d1331ad66,"Proceedings - 2021 2nd International Seminar on Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Information Technology, AINIT 2021",Yes,Include,I1.2,"",Include,
Wu Y.; Zou D.; Dou S.; Yang S.; Yang W.; Cheng F.; Liang H.; Jin H.,SCDetector: Software Functional Clone Detection Based on Semantic Tokens Analysis,"Code clone detection is to find out code fragments with similar functionalities, which has been more and more important in software engineering. Many approaches have been proposed to detect code clones, in which token-based methods are the most scalable but cannot handle semantic clones because of the lack of consideration of program semantics. To address the issue, researchers conduct program analysis to distill the program semantics into a graph representation and detect clones by matching the graphs. However, such approaches suffer from low scalability since graph matching is typically time-consuming. In this paper, we propose SCDetector to combine the scalability of token-based methods with the accuracy of graph-based methods for software functional clone detection. Given a function source code, we first extract the control flow graph by static analysis. Instead of using traditional heavyweight graph matching, we treat the graph as a social network and apply social-network-centrality analysis to dig out the centrality of each basic block. Then we assign the centrality to each token in a basic block and sum the centrality ofthe same token in different basic blocks. By this, a graph is turned into certain tokens with graph details (i.e., centrality), called semantic tokens. Finally, these semantic tokens are fed into a Siamese architecture neural network to train a code clone detector. We evaluate SCDetector on two large datasets of functionally similar code. Experimental results indicate that our system is superior to four state-of-the-art methods (i.e., SourcererCC, Deckard, RtvNN, and ASTNN) and the time cost of SCDetector is 14 times less than a traditional graph-based method (i.e., CCSharp) on detecting semantic clones. © 2020 ACM.",Conference paper,2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099212810&doi=10.1145%2f3324884.3416562&partnerID=40&md5=7637baf6c518b1c7013ceb5c4b83a3ee,"Proceedings - 2020 35th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2020",Yes,Include,I1.2,"","",""
Wang W.; Li G.; Ma B.; Xia X.; Jin Z.,Detecting Code Clones with Graph Neural Network and Flow-Augmented Abstract Syntax Tree,"Code clones are semantically similar code fragments pairs that are syntactically similar or different. Detection of code clones can help to reduce the cost of software maintenance and prevent bugs. Numerous approaches of detecting code clones have been proposed previously, but most of them focus on detecting syntactic clones and do not work well on semantic clones with different syntactic features. To detect semantic clones, researchers have tried to adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent semantic features from data. Especially, to leverage grammar information, several approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved significant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages. However, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural information of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control flow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this paper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs with explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of graph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs. As far as we have concerned, we are the first to apply graph neural networks on the domain of code clone detection.

Cai J.; Li B.; Zhang T.; Zhang J.; Sun X.,Fine-grained smart contract vulnerability detection by heterogeneous code feature learning and automated dataset construction,"Context: Recently, several deep learning based smart contract vulnerability detection approaches have been proposed. However, challenges still exist in applying deep learning for fine-grained vulnerability detection in smart contracts, including the lack of the dataset with sufficient statement-level labeled smart contract samples and neglect of heterogeneity between syntax and semantic features during code feature learning. Objective: To utilize deep learning for fine-grained smart contract vulnerability detection, we propose a security best practices (SBP) based dataset construction approach to address the scarcity of datasets. Moreover, we propose a syntax-sensitive graph neural network to address the challenge of heterogeneous code feature learning. Method: The dataset construction approach is motivated by the insight that smart contract code fragments guarded by security best practices may contain vulnerabilities in their original unguarded code form. Thus, we locate and strip security best practices from the smart contract code to recover its original vulnerable code form and perform sample labeling. Meanwhile, as the heterogeneity between tree-structured syntax features embodied inside the abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph-structured semantic features reflected by relations between statements, we propose a code graph whose nodes are each statement's AST subtree with a syntax-sensitive graph neural network that enhances the graph neural network by a child-sum tree-LSTM cell to learn these heterogeneous features for fine-grained smart contract vulnerability detection. Results: We compare our approach with three state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches that only support contract-level vulnerability detection and two popular static analysis-based approaches that support fine detection granularity. The experiment results show that our approach outperforms the baselines at both coarse and fine granularities. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose utilizing security best practices inside the smart contract code to construct the dataset with statement-level labels.

Lin X.; Zhou M.; Cao S.; Wang J.; Sun X.,The Best of Both Worlds: Integrating Semantic Features with Expert Features for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection,"Over the past few years, smart contract suffers from serious security threats of vulnerabilities, resulting in enormous economic losses. What’s worse, due to the immutable and irreversible features, vulnerable smart contracts which have been deployed in the the blockchain can only be detected rather than fixed. Conventional approaches heavily rely on hand-crafted vulnerability rules, which is time-consuming and difficult to cover all the cases. Recent deep learning approaches alleviate this issue but fail to explore the integration of them together to boost the smart contract vulnerability detection yet. Therefore, we propose to build a novel model, SmartFuSE, for the smart contract vulnerability detection by leveraging the best of semantic features and expert features. SmartFuSE performs static analysis to respectively extract vulnerability-specific expert patterns and joint graph structures at the function-level to frame the rich program semantics of vulnerable code, and leverages a novel graph neural network with the hybrid attention pooling layer to focus on critical vulnerability features. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed SmartFuSE, we conducted extensive experiments on 40k contracts in two benchmarks.

Vulnerability detection and repair are necessary to ensure the security of the blockchain. Currently, the-state-of-art smart contract vulnerability detection methods (e.g. Oyente and Securify) use heuristics based on human-designed algorithms, which have certain shortcomings in different application scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a smart contract vulnerability detection method, i.e. CuVuD, which uses Propagation Chain Learning to solve the current vulnerability detection problem. This method first parses the source code, then obtains and trims the propagation chain of smart contracts, and finally detects vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

However, due to their immutability, smart contracts still exhibit various vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit, resulting in significant losses. Numerous smart contracts on various blockchains, including Ethereum, have been attacked due to various vulnerabilities. The inefficiency of detecting these vulnerabilities has become a major bottleneck in advancing blockchain and smart contracts. Although detecting smart contract vulnerabilities has attracted much attention, most existing machine learning-based methods rely on adequate expert knowledge and target only specific known vulnerabilities via binary classification models. To address this limitation, our proposed approach introduced a general vulnerability detection method that can be applied to identify various common vulnerabilities via a uniform framework.

The current vulnerability detection methods for contracts are either based on fixed expert rules, which are inefficient, or rely on simplistic deep learning techniques that do not fully leverage contract semantic information. Therefore, there is ample room for improvement in terms of detection precision. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a vulnerability detector based on deep learning techniques, graph representation, and Transformer, called GRATDet. The method first performs swapping, insertion, and symbolization operations for contract functions, increasing the amount of small sample data. Each line of code is then treated as a basic semantic element, and information such as control and data relationships is extracted to construct a new representation in the form of a Line Graph (LG), which shows more structural features that differ from the serialized presentation of the contract. Finally, the node information and edge information of the graph are jointly learned using an improved Transformer–GP model to extract information globally and locally, and the fused features are used for vulnerability detection.

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms.

Given Ethereum smart contracts, either in source code or bytecode form, and vulnerable or clean, MANDO-HGT custom-builds heterogeneous contract graphs (HCGs) to represent control-flow and/or function-call information of the code. It then adapts heterogeneous graph transformers (HGTs) with customized meta relations for graph nodes and edges to learn their embeddings and train classifiers for detecting various vulnerability types in the nodes and graphs of the contracts more accurately.

Then, we apply two different training models, i.e., graph neural network (GNN) and graph matching network (GMN), to learn the embedding of ASG and measure the similarity of the contract pairs. In this way, vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by calculating the similarity to labeled ones. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the superiority of our approaches to state-of-the-art competitors.

Our validation of real-world smart contract datasets shows that MANDO-GURU can significantly improve many other vulnerability detection techniques by up to 24% in terms of the F1-score at the contract level, depending on vulnerability types. It is the first learning-based tool for Ethereum smart contracts that identify vulnerabilities at the line level and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based techniques by up to 63.4%. Our tool is publicly available at https://github.com/MANDO-Project/ge-sc-machine.

Yang S.; Gu X.; Shen B.,Self-Supervised Learning of Smart Contract Representations,"Learning smart contract representations can greatly facilitate the development of smart contracts in many tasks such as bug detection and clone detection. Existing approaches for learning program representations are difficult to apply to smart contracts which have insufficient data and significant homogenization. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose SRCL, a novel, self-supervised approach for learning smart contract representations. Unlike ex-isting supervised methods, which are tied on task-specific data labels, SRCL leverages large-scale unlabeled data by self-supervised learning of both local and global information of smart contracts. It automatically extracts structural sequences from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Then, two discriminators are designed to guide the Transformer encoder to learn local and global semantic features of smart contracts. We evaluate SRCL on a dataset of 75,006 smart contracts collected from Etherscan.

Liu Z.; Wang R.; Japkowicz N.; Gomes H.M.; Peng B.; Zhang W.,SeGDroid: An Android malware detection method based on sensitive function call graph learning[Formula presented],"Malware is still a challenging security problem in the Android ecosystem, as malware is often obfuscated to evade detection. In such case, semantic behavior feature extraction is crucial for training a robust malware detection model. In this paper, we propose a novel Android malware detection method (named SeGDroid) that focuses on learning the semantic knowledge from sensitive function call graphs (FCGs). Specifically, we devise a graph pruning method to build a sensitive FCG on the base of an original FCG. The method preserves the sensitive API (security-related API) call context and removes the irrelevant nodes of FCGs. We propose a node representation method based on word2vec and social-network-based centrality to extract attributes for graph nodes. Our representation aims at extracting the semantic knowledge of the function calls and the structure of graphs. Using this representation, we induce graph embeddings of the sensitive FCGs associated with node attributes using a graph convolutional neural network algorithm. To provide a model explanation, we further propose a method that calculates node importance. This creates a mechanism for understanding malicious behavior. The experimental results show that SeGDroid achieves an F-score of 98% in the case of malware detection on the CICMal2020 dataset and an F-score of 96% in the case of malware family classification on the MalRadar dataset.

Wu H.; Luktarhan N.; Tian G.; Song Y.,An Android Malware Detection Approach to Enhance Node Feature Differences in a Function Call Graph Based on GCNs,"The smartphone has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives, and the Android operating system is widely installed on our smartphones. This makes Android smartphones a prime target for malware. In order to address threats posed by malware, many researchers have proposed different malware detection approaches, including using a function call graph (FCG). Although an FCG can capture the complete call–callee semantic relationship of a function, it will be represented as a huge graph structure. The presence of many nonsensical nodes affects the detection efficiency. At the same time, the characteristics of the graph neural networks (GNNs) make the important node features in the FCG tend toward similar nonsensical node features during the propagation process. In our work, we propose an Android malware detection approach to enhance node feature differences in an FCG. Firstly, we propose an API-based node feature by which we can visually analyze the behavioral properties of different functions in the app and determine whether their behavior is benign or malicious. Then, we extract the FCG and the features of each function from the decompiled APK file. Next, we calculate the API coefficient inspired by the idea of the TF–IDF algorithm and extract the sensitive function called subgraph (S-FCSG) based on API coefficient ranking. Finally, before feeding the S-FCSG and node features into the GCN model, we add the self-loop for each node of the S-FCSG. A 1-D convolutional neural network and fully connected layers are used for further feature extraction and classification, respectively. The experimental result shows that our approach enhances the node feature differences in an FCG, and the detection accuracy is greater than that of models using other features, suggesting that malware detection based on a graph structure and GNNs has a lot of space for future study. © 2023 by the authors.",Article,2023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160444990&doi=10.3390%2fs23104729&partnerID=40&md5=f7b434d3d80a359e530ff86feacaa673,Sensors,Yes,Exclude,E1.4,"","",""
Miao H.; Bao H.; Tang Z.; Li W.; Wang W.; Chen H.; Liu F.; Sun Y.,AST2Vec: A Robust Neural Code Representation for Malicious PowerShell Detection,"In recent years, PowerShell has become a commonly used carrier to wage cyber attacks. As a script, PowerShell is easy to obfuscate to evade detection. Thus, they are difficult to detect directly using traditional anti-virus software. Existing advanced detection methods generally recover obfuscated scripts before detection. However, most deobfuscation tools can not achieve precise recovery on obfuscated scripts due to emerging obfuscation techniques. To solve the problem, we propose a robust neural code representation method, namely AST2Vec, to detect malicious PowerShell without de-obfuscating scripts. 6 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) recovery-related statement nodes are defined to identify obfuscated subtrees. Then AST2Vec splits the large AST of entire PowerShell scripts into a set of small subtrees rooted by these 6 types of nodes and performs tree-based neural embeddings on all extracted subtrees by capturing lexical and syntactical knowledge of statement nodes. Based on the sequence of statement vectors, a bidirectional recursive neural network (Bi-RNN) is modeled to leverage the context of statements and finally produce vector representation of scripts.

Rozi M.F.; Ban T.; Ozawa S.; Yamada A.; Takahashi T.; Kim S.; Inoue D.,Detecting Malicious JavaScript Using Structure-Based Analysis of Graph Representation,"Malicious JavaScript code in web applications poses a significant threat as cyber attackers exploit it to perform various malicious activities. Detecting these malicious scripts is challenging, given their diverse nature and the continuous evolution of attack techniques. Most approaches formulate this task as a static or sequential feature of the script, which is insufficient in terms of flexibility to various attack techniques and the ability to capture the script's semantic meaning. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach that leverages JavaScript code's abstract syntax tree (AST) representation, focusing on distinctive syntactic structure features. The proposed approach uses graph neural networks to extract structural features from the AST graph while considering the attribute features of individual nodes, which uses neural message passing with neighborhood aggregation. The proposed method encodes both the local AST graph structure and attributes of the nodes. It enables capturing the source code's semantic meaning and exploits the signature structure in the AST representations. The proposed method consistently achieved high detection performance in extensive experiments on two different datasets, with accuracy scores of 99.4% and 96.92%. The obtained evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately detecting malicious JavaScript code, with our proposed method successfully detecting more than 81% for various attack types and achieving an almost twofold performance improvement on JS-Droppers compared to the sequence-based approach.

Webshells, which are backdoors to websites, are commonly used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to web servers. However, traditional methods for detecting webshells often fail to produce satisfactory results due to the use of obfuscation or encryption to conceal their characteristics. In recent years, webshell detection methods based on deep learning (DL) have received significant attention, but they struggle to preserve the syntax and semantic information contained in the source code. In this paper, we propose a structural-aware webshell detection system to address these problems, denoted as SAWD. Specifically, we first generate the control flow graph (CFG) with syntax and semantic information from the PHP source code. Then, we leverage CFG to build our graph representation, which consists of the adjacency matrix and keywords-based basic block features. Finally, based on our graph representation, we adopt convolutional neural networks (GCN) combined with graph pooling to detect webshells more efficiently.

Detecting malware effectively is a non-trivial problem due to the high overlap in behaviors between malware and benign apps. Most existing automated Android malware detection methods use statistic features extracted from apps or graphs generated from method calls to identify malware. However, the methods that only use statistic features lead to false positives due to ignoring program semantics. Existing graph-based approaches suffer scalability problems due to the heavy-weight program analysis and time-consuming graph matching. In addition, graph-based approaches could be evaded by modifying dependencies among method calls. As a result, crafted malicious apps resemble the benign ones.In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based detection system, named RGDroid, which is capable of detecting malware under graph structural attacks. It combines API information extracted from Android document and learns behavior features from function call graph by graph neural network. Specifically, to defend against graph adversarial attacks, RGDroid reduces the connectivity of different functional parts to mitigate the effect of structural modifications on the final graph embedding. To comprehensively evaluate the robustness of RGDroid, we implement four influential graph adversarial attacks to simulate current capabilities and knowledge of Android malware attackers.

Recent work is considering hybrid models and multi-view learning. However, they use only simple features, limiting the accuracy of these approaches in practice. This study proposes DeepCatra, a multi-view learning approach for Android malware detection, whose model consists of a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and a graph neural network (GNN) as subnets. The two subnets rely on features extracted from statically computed call traces leading to critical APIs derived from public vulnerabilities. For each Android app, DeepCatra first constructs its call graph and computes call traces reaching critical APIs. Then, temporal opcode features used by the BiLSTM subnet are extracted from the call traces, while flow graph features used by the GNN subnet are constructed from all call traces and inter-component communications. We evaluate the effectiveness of DeepCatra by comparing it with several state-of-the-art detection approaches.

Hu J.L.; Ebrahimi M.; Li W.; Li X.; Chen H.,Multi-view Representation Learning from Malware to Defend Against Adversarial Variants,"Deep learning-based adversarial malware detectors have yielded promising results in detecting never-before-seen malware executables without relying on expensive dynamic behavior analysis and sandbox. Despite their abilities, these detectors have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial malware variants - meticulously modified, functionality-preserving versions of original malware executables generated by machine learning. Due to the nature of these adversarial modifications, these adversarial methods often use a single view of malware executables (i.e., the binary/hexadecimal view) to generate adversarial malware variants. This provides an opportunity for the defenders (i.e., malware detectors) to detect the adversarial variants by utilizing more than one view of a malware file (e.g., source code view in addition to the binary view). The rationale behind this idea is that while the adversary focuses on the binary view, certain characteristics of the malware file in the source code view remain untouched which leads to the detection of the adversarial malware variants. To capitalize on this opportunity, we propose Adversarially Robust Multiview Malware Defense (ARMD), a novel multi-view learning framework to improve the robustness of DL-based malware detectors against adversarial variants.

Ling X.; Wu L.; Deng W.; Qu Z.; Zhang J.; Zhang S.; Ma T.; Wang B.; Wu C.; Ji S.,MalGraph: Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Robust Windows Malware Detection,"With the ever-increasing malware threats, malware detection plays an indispensable role in protecting information systems. Although tremendous research efforts have been made, there are still two key challenges hindering them from being applied to accurately and robustly detect malwares. Firstly, most of them represent executables with shallow features, but ignore their semantic and structural information. Secondly, they are primarily based on representations that can be easily modified by attackers and thus cannot provide robustness against adversarial attacks. To tackle the challenges, we present MalGraph, which first represents executables with hierarchical graphs and then uses an end-to-end learning framework based on graph neural networks for malware detection. In particular, a hierarchical graph consists of a function call graph that captures the interaction semantics among different functions at the inter-function level and corresponding control-flow graphs for learning the structural semantics of each function at the intra-function level. We argue the abstraction and hierarchy nature of hierarchical graphs makes them not only easy to capture rich structural information of executables, but also be immune to adversarial attacks. Evaluations show that MalGraph not only outperforms state-of-the-art malware detection, but also exhibits stronger robustness against adversarial attacks by a large margin. © 2022 IEEE.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133286884&doi=10.1109%2fINFOCOM48880.2022.9796786&partnerID=40&md5=1042ba15bbc091936aab376b6e16918e,Proceedings - IEEE INFOCOM,Yes,Exclude,E1.4,"",Include,Exclude

In the previous research, most detection methods cannot directly locate malicious code, and some methods with the locate ability can only find some specific types of malicious operations. This paper proposed a graph convolution algorithm and weighted mechanism to find malicious nodes implied in the Android application function call graph and provided a general method for malicious code location.

Miner malware has obvious behavior patterns in order to participate in blockchain computing. However, most miner malware detection methods use raw bytes feature and sequential opcode as detection features. It is difficult for these methods to obtain better detection results due to not modeling robust features. In this paper, a miner malware identification method based on graph classification network is designed by analyzing the features of function call graph and control flow graph of miner malware, called MBGINet. MBGINet can model the behavior graph relationship of miner malware by extracting the connection features of critical nodes in the behavior graph. Finally, MBGINet transforms these node features into the feature vectors of the graph for miner malware identification. In the test experiments, datasets with different volumes are used for simulating real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that the MBGINet method achieves a leading and stable performance compared to the dedicated opcode detection method and obtains an accuracy improvement of 3.08% on the simulated in-the-wild dataset. Meanwhile, MBGINet gains an advantage over the general malware detection method Malconv.

This turns a secure dependency into an insecure dependency, and hinders the maintenance of security in software development projects, since current tools do not cover all possible configurations of dependencies. In this paper, our approach that enables the analysis and inference of the configuration of dependencies of projects in terms of potentially vulnerable configurations. The proposal is developed by constructing a dependency graph network attributed to vulnerabilities. Formal models are integrated based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to enable automatic analysis, such as the identification of the most secure configuration of dependencies. The automatic analysis facilitates ascertaining the vulnerability-free configurations of dependencies with maximum and minimum vulnerability impacts. This proposal has been evaluated by analysing more than 140 Python open-source code repositories and better results than other proposals have been achieved. © 2023 The Author(s)",Article,2024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182635943&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2023.103669&partnerID=40&md5=834224e767b5bba537bc8f8ced49d010,Computers and Security,Yes,Exclude,E1.1,"","",""

It is however difficult for developers to reveal code change propagate channels due to sophisticated interrelationships among code entities. In this work, we propose a novel graph representation for the changed code entities and related code entities changed within a range of space and time so that the types of relationships along which the changes are propagated can be explicitly presented. Then a subgraph mining technique is used to find the frequent change propagation channels. We finally reveal 40 types of frequent change propagation channels that cover over 98% cases of code change propagation in five well-known open-source Java projects. We find evidence that the code changes propagated through an unchanged intermediate code entity consume more time than those through a changed one, indicating the difficulties in maintaining code entities that related through indirect relationships. We find that a small proportion of code entities frequently appear in the FCPCs, and confirm the semantic relationships between code entities covered by 50 instances of FCPCs, indicating potential usefulness for developers to explain the range of change impact from given source code changes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182227254&doi=10.1016%2fj.jss.2023.111912&partnerID=40&md5=dea6dc9ea39b04ebffd934c96940f2bd,Journal of Systems and Software,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Chen N.; Sun Q.; Wang J.; Li X.; Gao M.,Pass-Tuning: Towards Structure-Aware Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Code Representation Learning,"Code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) have recently become the de-facto paradigm for various tasks in the domain of code intelligence. To achieve excellent performance, the widely used strategy is to fine-tune all the parameters of CodePTMs. However, as the model size increases along with the number of downstream tasks, this strategy becomes excessively expensive. There are also some prior works that utilize Parameter-Efficient Learning (PEL) methods for model tuning in natural language processing to mitigate similar problems, but applying them directly to CodePTMs fails to capture the inherent structural characteristics of codes. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose Pass-Tuning for structure-aware Parameter-Efficient code representation learning. Specifically, a plug-and-play graph neural network module that can learn from Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is employed as a tunable prefix. On the one hand, Pass-Tuning can further exploit the structural information of source code. On the other hand, it could serve as a replacement for full fine-tuning.

This causes a potential threat to the project and threatens the security of the software supply chain. Therefore, to protect the code security, the Python open-source code traceability model based on graph neural networks is proposed to calculate the similarity between the programmers' Python code and the Python open-source code. Firstly, each function in Python code is parsed into one Type Abstract Syntax Tree. Secondly, graph neural networks are used to calculate the function similarity between the two Type Abstract Syntax Trees of the original code and open-source code. Thirdly, the overall similarity of a Python project that consists of many functions is calculated based on the function similarity following the maximum retention principle. The experiment was conducted on three datasets: StudentWork, GitDown, and Obfuscated-GitDown. The experiment shows that the results calculated by our model are more reasonable, which places more emphasis on similarity in code structure than on code text.

Wen X.; Gao C.; Ye J.; Li Y.; Tian Z.; Jia Y.; Wang X.,Meta-Path Based Attentional Graph Learning Model for Vulnerability Detection,"In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely used in code vulnerability detection. The DL-based methods typically extract structural information from source code, e.g., code structure graph, and adopt neural networks such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn the graph representations. However, these methods fail to consider the heterogeneous relations in the code structure graph, i.e., the heterogeneous relations mean that the different types of edges connect different types of nodes in the graph, which may obstruct the graph representation learning.

Wang C.; Wu Y.; Zhang X.,Mucha: Multi-channel based Code Change Representation Learning for Commit Message Generation,"Commit messages provide a natural language description of the changes made to the code, enabling developers to swiftly comprehend the alterations without delving into the implementation complexities. Nevertheless, generating commit messages faces a considerable challenge due to the semantic and structural differences between code and natural language. Several researchers have put forward automated techniques aimed at generating commit messages. However, the full potential of code-related information is not yet fully harnessed. In this paper, we propose a Multi-channel based Code Change Representation Learning for Commit Message Generation(Mucha). We first compare the changed code and the corresponding AST before and after the change. Subsequently, we extract the altered information from various granularities and employ a multi-channel approach to capture the code changes, utilizing the extracted information as the basis for our analysis. In addition, we also use the query mechanism and attention mechanism to assist in learning the final code change representation. We build the experimental dataset, since there is still no publicly sufficient dataset for this task. The release of this dataset would serve as a valuable contribution towards advancing research in this particular field. We conduct a comprehensive experiment to assess the effectiveness of Mucha.

Despite demonstrated effectiveness in multiple tasks, CC2Vec has several limitations: 1) it considers only coarse-grained information about code changes, and 2) it relies on log messages rather than the self-contained content of the code changes. In this work, we propose CCBERT (Code Change BERT), a new Transformer-based pre-trained model that learns a generic representation of code changes based on a large-scale dataset containing massive unlabeled code changes. CCBERT is pre-trained on four proposed self-supervised objectives that are specialized for learning code change representations based on the contents of code changes. CCBERT perceives fine-grained code changes at the token level by learning from the old and new versions of the content, along with the edit actions. Our experiments demonstrate that CCBERT significantly outperforms CC2Vec or the state-of-the-art approaches of the downstream tasks by 7.7%-14.0% in terms of different metrics and tasks.

Zhang Z.; Liu L.; Chang J.; Wang L.; Liao L.,Commit Classification via Diff-Code GCN based on System Dependency Graph,"Commit Classification, an automated process of classifying Diff-Code based on their purpose, plays a crucial role in enhancing comprehension and the quality of software. Some previous studies only used commit messages or code metrics to represent diff-code but lacked code context structure characterization. Alternatively, other studies have used Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) tokens to represent diff-code but did not consider contextual information like data dependency and control dependency. In this paper, we propose a new commit classification model called Diff-Code GCN (Graph Convolutional Network). Specifically, we firstly build a more detailed system dependency graph (SDG) of the commit, and secondly use program slicing to search the impact scope of diff-code. Thirdly, we extract the scope as a Change Impact Graph (CIG). We utilize GCN to extract contextual information from CIG and combine it with syntactic changed information of ASTs to represent the commit. Finally, we classify the commit into three maintenance categories (corrective, perfective, and adaptive).

Chen S.; Xu S.; Yao Y.; Xu F.,Untangling Composite Commits by Attributed Graph Clustering,"During software development, it is considered to be a best practice if each commit represents one distinct concern, such as fixing a bug or adding a new feature. However, developers may not always follow this practice and sometimes tangle multiple concerns into a single composite commit. This makes automatic commit untangling a necessary task, and recent approaches mainly untangle commits via applying graph clustering on the code dependency graph. In this paper, we propose a new commit untangling approach, ComUnt, to decompose the composite commits into atomic ones. Different from existing approaches, ComUnt is built upon the observation that both the textual content of code statements and the dependencies between code statements contain useful semantic information so as to better comprehend the committed code changes. Based on this observation, ComUnt first constructs an attributed graph for each commit, where code statements and various code dependencies are modeled as nodes and edges, respectively, and the textual body of code statements are maintained as node attributes. It then conducts attributed graph clustering on the constructed graph. The used attributed graph clustering algorithm can simultaneously encode both graph structure and node attributes so as to better separate the code changes into clusters with distinct concerns. We evaluate our approach on nine C# projects, and the experimental result shows that ComUnt improves the state-of-the-art by 7.8% in terms of untangling accuracy, and meanwhile it is more than 6 times faster.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference paper,2022,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139556972&doi=10.1145%2f3545258.3545267&partnerID=40&md5=243fc68212f7e1da0843bdafb29510f9,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,Yes,Include,I1.1,"",Include,

Chourasia P.; Ramakrishnan G.; Apte V.; Kumar S.,Algorithm Identification in Programming Assignments,"Current autograders of programming assignments are typically program output based; they fall short in many ways: e.g. they do not carry out subjective evaluations such as code quality, or whether the code has followed any instructor specified constraints; this is still done manually by teaching assistants. In this paper, we tackle a specific aspect of such evaluation: to verify whether a program implements a specific algorithm that the instructor specified. An algorithm, e.g. bubble sort, can be coded in myriad different ways, but a human can always understand the code and spot, say a bubble sort, vs. a selection sort. We develop and compare four approaches to do precisely this: given the source code of a program known to implement a certain functionality, identify the algorithm used, among a known set of algorithms. The approaches are based on code similarity, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with tree or graph kernels, and transformer neural architectures based only source code (CodeBERT), and the extension of this that includes code structure (GraphCodeBERT). Furthermore, we use a model for explainability (LIME) to generate insights into why certain programs get certain labels. Results based on our datasets of sorting, searching and shortest path codes, show that GraphCodeBERT, fine-tuned with scrambled source code, i.e., where identifiers are replaced consistently with arbitrary words, gives the best performance in algorithm identification, with accuracy of 96-99% depending on the functionality.

Pourasghar B.; Izadkhah H.; Isazadeh A.; Lotfi S.,A graph-based clustering algorithm for software systems modularization,"Context: Clustering algorithms, as a modularization technique, are used to modularize a program aiming to understand large software systems as well as software refactoring. These algorithms partition the source code of the software system into smaller and easy-to-manage modules (clusters). The resulting decomposition is called the software system structure (or software architecture). Due to the NP-hardness of the modularization problem, evolutionary clustering approaches such as the genetic algorithm have been used to solve this problem. These methods do not make much use of the information and knowledge available in the artifact dependency graph which is extracted from the source code. Objective: To overcome the limitations of the existing modularization techniques, this paper presents a new modularization technique named GMA (Graph-based Modularization Algorithm). Methods: In this paper, a new graph-based clustering algorithm is presented for software modularization. To this end, the depth of relationships is used to compute the similarity between artifacts, as well as seven new criteria are proposed to evaluate the quality of a modularization. The similarity presented in this paper enables the algorithm to use graph-theoretic information. Results: To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm, ten folders of Mozilla Firefox with different domains and functions, along with four other applications, are selected. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces modularization closer to the human expert's decomposition (i.e., directory structure) than the other existing algorithms.

Zhang F.; Li G.; Liu C.; Song Q.,Flowchart-based cross-language source code similarity detection,"Source code similarity detection has various applications in code plagiarism detection and software intellectual property protection. In computer programming teaching, students may convert the source code written in one programming language into another language for their code assignment submission. Existing similarity measures of source code written in the same language are not applicable for the cross-language code similarity detection because of syntactic differences among different programming languages. Meanwhile, existing cross-language source similarity detection approaches are susceptible to complex code obfuscation techniques, such as replacing equivalent control structure and adding redundant statements. To solve this problem, we propose a cross-language code similarity detection (CLCSD) approach based on code flowcharts. In general, two source code fragments written in different programming languages are transformed into standardized code flowcharts (SCFC), and their similarity is obtained by measuring their corresponding SCFC. More specifically, we first introduce the standardized code flowchart (SCFC) model to be the uniform flowcharts representation of source code written in different languages. SCFC is language-independent, and therefore, it can be used as the intermediate structure for source code similarity detection. Meanwhile, transformation techniques are given to transform source code written in a specific programming language into an SCFC. Second, we propose the SCFC-SPGK algorithm based on the shortest path graph kernel to measure the similarity between two SCFCs. Thus, the similarity between two pieces of source code in different programming languages is given by the similarity between SCFCs. Experimental results show that compared with existing approaches, CLCSD has higher accuracy in cross-language source code similarity detection.

Gu X.; Zhang H.; Kim S.,CodeKernel: A graph kernel based approach to the selection of API usage examples,"Developers often want to find out how to use a certain API (e.g., FileReader.read in JDK library). API usage examples are very helpful in this regard. Over the years, many automated methods have been proposed to generate code examples by clustering and summarizing relevant code snippets extracted from a code corpus. These approaches simplify source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors. Such simplifications only model partial aspects of the code and tend to yield inaccurate examples. We propose CodeKernel, a graph kernel based approach to the selection of API usage examples. Instead of approximating source code as method invocation sequences or feature vectors, CodeKernel represents source code as object usage graphs. Then, it clusters graphs by embedding them into a continuous space using a graph kernel.

Ge X.; Pan Y.; Fan Y.; Fang C.,AMDroid: Android Malware Detection Using Function Call Graphs,"With the rapid development of the mobile Internet, Android has been the most popular mobile operating system. Due to the open nature of Android, c countless malicious applications are hidden in a large number of benign applications, which pose great threats to users. Most previous malware detection approaches mainly rely on features such as permissions, API calls, and opcode sequences. However, these approaches fail to capture structural semantics of applications. In this paper, we propose AMDroid that leverages function call graphs (FCGs) representing the behaviors of applications and applies graph kernels to automatically learn the structural semantics of applications from FCGs. We evaluate AMDroid on the Genome Project, and the experimental results show that AMDroid is effective to detect Android malware with 97.49% detection accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference paper,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073879922&doi=10.1109%2fQRS-C.2019.00027&partnerID=40&md5=450d90562bac5df641d3608f9d3d49f5,"Proceedings - Companion of the 19th IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability and Security, QRS-C 2019",Yes,Exclude,E1.4,"",Include,Exclude
Narayanan A.; Chandramohan M.; Chen L.; Liu Y.,A multi-view context-aware approach to Android malware detection and malicious code localization,"Many existing Machine Learning (ML) based Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security-sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with ML classifiers to achieve accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps’ behaviors with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterize several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevents them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localization. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder. MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information from apps’ dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view. Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides multi-view learning, MKLDroid’s unique and salient trait is its ability to locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g., methods/classes). Malicious code localization caters several important applications such as supporting human analysts studying malware behaviors, engineering malware signatures, and other counter-measures. Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets (incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localization experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify all the malice classes with 94% average recall. Our work opens up two new avenues in malware research: (i) enables the research community to elegantly look at Android malware behaviors in multiple perspectives simultaneously, and (ii) performing precise and scalable malicious code localization. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028588565&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-017-9539-8&partnerID=40&md5=8ecb03b5f443da3ffed5de80762b0e96,Empirical Software Engineering,Yes,Exclude,E1.4,"",Include,Exclude
Li W.; Saidi H.; Sanchez H.; Schäf M.; Schweitzer P.,Detecting similar programs via the weisfeiler-leman graph kernel,"With the increasing availability of source code on the Internet, many new approaches to retrieve, repair, and reuse code have emerged that rely on the ability to efficiently compute the similarity of two pieces of code. The meaning of similarity, however, heavily depends on the application domain. For predicting API calls, for example, programs can be considered similar if they call a specific set of functions in a similar way, while for automated bug fixing, it is important that similar programs share a similar data-flow. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute program similarity based on the Weisfeiler-Leman graph kernel. Our algorithm is able to operate on different graph-based representations of programs and thus can be applied in different domains. We show the usefulness of our approach in two experiments using data-flow similarity and API-call similarity. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Conference paper,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977581207&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-35122-3_21&partnerID=40&md5=efbb2de52959457686f86e3225086d73,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),No Access,Exclude,,"","",""

Automating SP to OOP migration is pivotal as it could reduce time that take in the manual process. Given this potential benefit, the issue is yet to be addressed by researchers. This paper addresses the scenario by modeling this problem as a graph clustering problem where SP functions and function calls are vertices and edges respectively. The challenge evolving the problem is to find optimized clusters from graphs. To aid this problem, certain heuristic algorithms based on Monte Carlo and Greedy approaches are being developed.

Given a known vulnerable function, the proposed method extrapolates to find similar functions in the code base. Vulnerability extrapolation is based on the observation that given a starting vulnerability, similar behavior may be present in many other functions. In order to capture similarity, we represent functions in terms of syntactic and semantic patterns. These patterns are based on several code features like API usage pattern, argument types and control flow graph (CFG) of the functions. We employ a recent technique, called graph kernel to compute similarity directly on the CFGs of functions.

Bavota G.; De Lucia A.; Marcus A.; Oliveto R.,Automating extract class refactoring: an improved method and its evaluation,"During software evolution the internal structure of the system undergoes continuous modifications. These continuous changes push away the source code from its original design, often reducing its quality, including class cohesion. In this paper we propose a method for automating the Extract Class refactoring. The proposed approach analyzes (structural and semantic) relationships between the methods in a class to identify chains of strongly related methods. The identified method chains are used to define new classes with higher cohesion than the original class, while preserving the overall coupling between the new classes and the classes interacting with the original class. The proposed approach has been first assessed in an artificial scenario in order to calibrate the parameters of the approach. The data was also used to compare the new approach with previous work. Then it has been empirically evaluated on real Blobs from existing open source systems in order to assess how good and useful the proposed refactoring solutions are considered by software engineers and how well the proposed refactorings approximate refactorings done by the original developers. We found that the new approach outperforms a previously proposed approach and that developers find the proposed solutions useful in guiding refactorings. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84909999876&doi=10.1007%2fs10664-013-9256-x&partnerID=40&md5=a9c97552aca1cd265b4034330f680669,Empirical Software Engineering,Yes,Include,"I1.1,I2.3","",,

Qiu D.; Zhang Q.; Fang S.,Reconstructing Software High-Level Architecture by Clustering Weighted Directed Class Graph,"Software architecture reconstruction plays an important role in software reuse, evolution and maintenance. Clustering is a promising technique for software architecture reconstruction. However, the representation of software, which serves as clustering input, and the clustering algorithm need to be improved in real applications. The representation should contain appropriate and adequate information of software. Furthermore, the clustering algorithm should be adapted to the particular demands of software architecture reconstruction well. In this paper, we first extract Weighted Directed Class Graph (WDCG) to represent object-oriented software. WDCG is a structural and quantitative representation of software, which contains not only the static information of software source code but also the dynamic information of software execution. Then we propose a WDCG-based Clustering Algorithm (WDCG-CA) to reconstruct high-level software architecture. WDCG-CA makes full use of the structural and quantitative information of WDCG, and avoids wrong compositions and arbitrary partitions successfully in the process of reconstructing software architecture. We introduce four metrics to evaluate the performance of WDCG-CA. The results of the comparative experiments show that WDCG-CA outperforms the comparative approaches in most cases in terms of the four metrics. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Article,2015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84941884483&doi=10.1142%2fS0218194015500072&partnerID=40&md5=ac56e15253d0402f32dac893408a22ad,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""
Selim M.; Siddik M.S.; Rahman T.; Gias A.U.; Khaled S.M.,Approximating object based architecture for legacy software written in procedural languages using Variable Neighborhood Search,"Legacy software, often written in procedural languages, could be a major concern for organizations due to low maintainability. A possible way out could be migrating the software to object oriented architecture, which is easier to maintain due to better modularity. However, a manual migration could take significant time and thus an automated process is required. This migration problem has been modeled as an optimal graph clustering problem where vertices and edges are represented by function and function calls respectively. Solution to this problem is NP-hard and thus meta-heuristic base approaches are potential to get near optimal result. This paper presents a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) approach for addressing the modeled graph clustering problem. The method provides a set of clusters that gives a clue for possible structure of the object oriented architecture. This approach is based on the objective to minimize the coupling and maximize the cohesion within the clusters. The proposed algorithm was implemented and its performance was compared with state of the art techniques. It is observed that the proposed method produced 37.15% and 12.02% better results in contrast to genetic algorithm and local search heuristics. © 2014 IEEE.",Conference paper,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949924477&doi=10.1109%2fSKIMA.2014.7083558&partnerID=40&md5=fa5870a96cd8c14d04b26a176d463d65,"SKIMA 2014 - 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications",Yes,Include,I1.1,"","",""

Kinable J.; Kostakis O.,Malware classification based on call graph clustering,"Each day, anti-virus companies receive tens of thousands samples of potentially harmful executables. Many of the malicious samples are variations of previously encountered malware, created by their authors to evade pattern-based detection. Dealing with these large amounts of data requires robust, automatic detection approaches. This paper studies malware classification based on call graph clustering. By representing malware samples as call graphs, it is possible to abstract certain variations away, enabling the detection of structural similarities between samples. The ability to cluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques possible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster. To compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores via graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance. Next, to facilitate the discovery of similar malware samples, we employ several clustering algorithms, including k-medoids and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Clustering experiments are conducted on a collection of real malware samples, and the results are evaluated against manual classifications provided by human malware analysts. Experiments show that it is indeed possible to accurately detect malware families via call graph clustering. We anticipate that in the future, call graphs can be used to analyse the emergence of new malware families, and ultimately to automate implementation of generic detection schemes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag France.",Article,2011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80255126150&doi=10.1007%2fs11416-011-0151-y&partnerID=40&md5=629cbf2afef398da345c92a519e46121,Journal in Computer Virology,Yes,Exclude,E1.4,"",Include,Exclude
