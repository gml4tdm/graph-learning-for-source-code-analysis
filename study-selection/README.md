# !Important Details About Inclusion/Exclusion Rules!

The study selection uses slightly differently numbered 
inclusion and exclusion rules as reported in the paper.

Specifically, the paper reports the rules as we understand 
them and applied them in the end. However, the study selection
files use a "Work in Progress" version of these criteria. 

The following is an overview of all the rules as found
in the study selection files:
