# Details About Paper "Titles"

The reference data for each paper was retrieved 
from the CSV file downloaded from Scopus 
after performing the search query.
The titles for every paper were programmatically 
extracted. This project sometimes failed
(e.g. only an author name was extracted).
By accident, we lost the original mapping 
of these stripped file names to the full
references. In cases where we could not reconstruct the full reference
(e.g. due to only an author name being extracted),
the "Full Reference" column in the cluster CSV is empty.
