    description: n/a
    artefacts:
      - name: Code Clone Source Code
        details: |-
          For a given pair of code clones, where one has been modified,
          three artefacts are used:
          1) Original code of the changed clone 
          2) Modified code of the changed clone
          3) Code of the other clone
    vertex-type:
      - name: Statement
        details: |-
          Every node has a triple-vector (Existence Vector), 
          indicating whether that node is present in the PDG 
          of every included code snippet.
    edge-type:
      - name: Data Dependence Edge
        details: n/a
      - name: Control Dependence Edge
        details: n/a
      - name: Execution Edge
        details: Represent order of node execution
      - name: Mapping Edge
        details: |-
          Edge connecting two "corresponding" nodes originating from the PDGs of two code snippets,
          but which do not contain the exact same statement
    vertex-features: |-
      Code encoded using CodeBERT; vector concatenated with the existence vector
