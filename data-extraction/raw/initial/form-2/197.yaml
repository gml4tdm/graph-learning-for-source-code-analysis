        Input: pair of code graphs 
        
        1) GCN (each graph individually) 
        2) Attention to compute weighted average of node embeddings for each graph
        3) Both resulting features are both passed to 
            i) Graph Matching Network
            ii) Pairwise Node Comparison 
        4) Results are added
        5) FNN (output: similarity score)
