      AST is linearised using depth first traversal
      to obtain sequence of tokens.
      
      Tokens are encoded using word2vec
      
      Sequence used as input for following network: 
      LSTM
      Global Max Pooling
      FNN Layer w/ tanh
      FNN Layer w/ linear 
      FNN Layer w/ sigmoid
      
      after training, the last two layers are removed 
      in order to obtain function level representations.
      
      The network is trained on the vulnerability 
      detection task. After training, it is used for embedding.
