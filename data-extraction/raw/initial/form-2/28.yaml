      architecture:
        One variational auto-encoder for every type of AST node.
      
        Embeddings are computed recursively; first leave nodes, then their parents.
      
        Leaf nodes have no payload, so the model only learns the structure.
      
        Both the encoder and decoder are single layer FNN models,
        with tanh and sigmoidal activation respectively.
