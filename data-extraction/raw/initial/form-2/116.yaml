      AST Nodes are sequenced using 
      depth first traversal.
      
      Fed into the following network:
      Embedding Layer 
      LSTM
      LSTM 
      FNN w/ ReLU 
      FNN w/ Linear
      
      Goal is to predict the "essential complexity",
      a proxy task of predicting a metric associated 
      with vulnerabilities. 
      
      The outputs of the last LSTM layer are used as 
      graph representations.
