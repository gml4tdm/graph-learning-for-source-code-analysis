        1) Embedding Layer for AST Nodes (unclear what exactly is encoded)
        2) ConvGNN (H = g_v^{k - 1} + \sum_{u \in N(v)} g_u^{k - 1}; g_v^k = FNN(H))
        3) Transformer-XL (to find important tokens in the graph)
        4) Output of Transformer-XL is fed into linear layer, then softmax.
