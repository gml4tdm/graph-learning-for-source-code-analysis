      Traverse AST in BFS order.
      For every node, output the pair (parent payload, node payload).
      
      The resulting text is then tokenized (four different ways; see paper for details).
      
      For BOW models, the tokens are used to compute a BOW representation 
      (4 different ways; see paper for details).
