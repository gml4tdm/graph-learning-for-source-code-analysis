      for every node, compute degree centrality, closeness centrality, and second order centrality.
      Create an RGB image, where each color dimension is a centrality multiplied by the node vector 
      (e.g. red = degree centrality * node vector).
      
      An image (RGB) is obtained by concatenating all node representations.
