      Features are represented as a 3D tensor, where the first two dimensions 
      represent nodes, and the third dimension represents features describing
      the relation between the two nodes.
      
      These features include data type/modifier information,
      operators between the two nodes, the parent child relationship between the two nodes (i.e. is_parent(i, e), with a one-hot entry for the node type of the child),
      control flow node information.
