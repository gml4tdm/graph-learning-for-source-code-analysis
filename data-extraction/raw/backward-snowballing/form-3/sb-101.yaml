        details: file
    vertex-type: ast

    vertex-features: node type, unclear if content (code tokens) are also used, but seems to be only node type
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: n/a

    other-features: |-
      AST linearised. Tokens (node type; code tokens unclear if used) are encoded using Glove.
      
      traditional code metrics are also used as features.
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - LSTM over linearised AST
      - LSTM over traditional code metrics (1 numerical input per "time step", hence 18 steps for 18D vector input)
      - concatenation followed by softmax
tasks:
  defect-prediction:
    training-objective: Classify file as defective or not.

    working-objective: Classify file as defective or not.
