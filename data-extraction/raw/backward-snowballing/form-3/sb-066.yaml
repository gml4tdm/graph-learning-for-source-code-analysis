    description: n/a
    artefacts:
      - name: source code
        details: n/a
    vertex-type: statement
    edge-type: control dependence/data dependence
    vertex-features: statements as sequences of tokens
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: adjacency matrix
    graph-features: n/a
    other-features: description of the code is used as feature
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - embedding layer for tokens
      - statement embedded as attention-weighted sum
      - mlp applied to columns of adjacency matrix
      - for each statement, connect its corresponding row from transformed adjacency matrix
      - Bidirectional LSTM over combined embeddings (lsat hidden state as code vector)
      - description encoded using embedding layer, Bidirectional LSTM, and max pooling over hidden states
      - cosine similarity between code and description vector
tasks:
  code-search:
    training-objective: Maximise similarity of related (code, description pairs); minimise similarity of unrelated pairs
    training-granularity: graph classification (kinda but not quite)
    working-objective: Compute similarity of code and query
    working-granularity: graph classification/regression (kinda but not quite)
    application: code Search
    supervision: supervised
