    architecture-attributes:
      - Reinforcement learning with actor-critic network
      - Code tokens fed into LSTM
      - AST into tree-based LSTM
      - Attention-weighted sum of node and token embeddings
      - Concatenate results of sums
      - FNN w/ tanh and softmax for output of _actor_ (action; next token)
      - MLP over actor output for critic (single value output)
