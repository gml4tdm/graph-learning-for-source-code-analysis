        details: n/a
    vertex-type: repositories/users
    edge-type: contributes
    vertex-features: |-
      for users: potential passwords/keys, occurrences of string "password" in a file, sensitive filetypes.
      
      for repos: vulnerability type(s) detected by scanner tool (secret leakage, classical vulnerabilities such as sql, etc.)

      The bipartite network is projected into two mono-partite networks (user network and repo network)
      
      Graphs are encoded using text associated deep walk

    working-objective: Cluster nodes together
    working-granularity: graph clustering
    application: identification of groups of vulnerable repositories and users (proactively identify vulnerable communities)
