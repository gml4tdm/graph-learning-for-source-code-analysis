    name: Augmented AST
    description: AST w/ additional edges

      - name: source code
        details: n/a
    vertex-type: ast/shared subtoken nodes (one for each unique subtoken) [vocab node]
    edge-type: ast/sibling/control flow/data flow
    vertex-features: token for vocab nodes, type for ast nodes
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: not specified
    graph-features: n/a
    other-features: n/a
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - vocab nodes vectorised using Character-level CNN
      - node types using embedding layer
      - ggnn
      - augmented with MLP for fill-in-the-blank
      - augmented with mean pooling and GRU for variable naming
tasks:
  fill-in-the-blank:
    training-objective: Given a graph where one node has been masked, predict the correct variable
    training-granularity: Node classification (kinda)
    working-objective: Given a graph where one node has no variable, predict the correct variable
    working-granularity: Node classification (kinda)
    application: Variable usage prediction
    supervision: supervised
  variable-naming:
    training-objective: Given a graph where one variable has been removed (i.e. it has no name), predict the name
    training-granularity: Graph to Sequence
    working-objective: Given a graph with an unnamed variable, predict the name for the variable
    working-granularity: Graph to Sequence
    application: Variable Naming
    supervision: supervised

    comments: The method is supposed to be general, while the two tasks are example evaluation tasks used in the paper
