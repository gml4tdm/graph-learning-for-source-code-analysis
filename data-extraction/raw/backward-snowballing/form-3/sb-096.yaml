      pre-order sequence of nodes, encoded using model-1, is used as input for model-2.
      
      Hand-crafted detection-related features are used.

      - cbow
  model-2:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - CNN w/ max pooling
      - hand-crafted features are concatenated with vectors extracted by the CNN
