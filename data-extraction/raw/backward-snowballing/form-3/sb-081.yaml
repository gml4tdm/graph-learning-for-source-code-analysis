      Paths between terminal nodes are extracted from the AST.
      For the terminal nodes, tokens are features. 
      The path itself (sequence of types, interlaced with up/down directions) are also features (i.e. a full path is a single feature)
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - embedding layers for tokens and paths
      - concat start token, path, and end token embeddings
      - fnn
      - attention-weighted sum of path vectors
      - (if necessary, softmax for prediction)
tasks:
  method-name-prediction:
    training-objective: Given a method, predict its name (from a corpus of possible method names)
    training-granularity: n/a
    working-objective: Given a method, predict its name (from a corpus of possible method names)
    working-granularity: n/a
    application: Method name prediction

    comments: The method is supposed to be more general, with name prediction being an evaluation application
