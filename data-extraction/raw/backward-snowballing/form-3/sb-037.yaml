      - name: source code
        details: pairs of source code for training (diff)
    vertex-type: ast
    edge-type: ast (bidirectional) / siblings
    vertex-features: not specified
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: not specified
    graph-features: n/a
    other-features: sequence of edit actions to transform first AST into the other
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - encoder/decoder
      - Edits encoded using embedding layers; fed into bidirectional LSTM to get representation of the full edit as single vector
      - encoder - GGNN w/ average pooling; LSTM over pooling outputs to capture edit history of the tree; LSTM also takes as input edit representation
      - decoder; softmax for action selection, pointer-like network for node selection implemented using FNN, value selector/predictor using FNN for add and copy operations
tasks:
  code-editing:
    training-objective: Given a tree and edit sequence, transform the tree into the other
    training-granularity: x to tree
    working-objective: Given a tree and edit sequence, transform the tree into the other
    working-granularity: x to tree
    application: program edit representation learning
    supervision: supervised
