models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - probably uses embedding layers
      - bug report processed using CNN
      - CNN over tokens in each node to compute node embeddings
      - Deep walk (skip gram for graphs based on random walk) over graph
      - all paths in CFG are traversed using LSTM, followed by mean pooling layer
      - pool all paths
      - concatenate with bug report
      - output
tasks:
  bug-localisation:
    training-objective: Correctly identify matching (report, file containing bug) pairs
    training-granularity: Graph Classification (but not quite)
    working-objective: Identify the file in which a given bug occurs
    working-granularity: Graph Classification (but not quite)
    application: Bug Localisation
    supervision: Supervised
