    architecture-attributes:
      - siamese network
      - tree-based LSTM, but with two feature vectors per node (everywhere where in normal tree-LSTM, a single input is given, a second term is added for the second input)
      - cosine similarity
tasks:
  clone-detection:
    training-objective: maximise similarity for related clone pairs, minimise similarity for unrelated pairs
    training-granularity: graph regression (but two inputs)
    working-objective: output similarity of two programs
    working-granularity: graph regression (but two inputs)
    application: code clone detection
    supervision: supervised
