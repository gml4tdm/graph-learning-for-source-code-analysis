      - name: source code
        details: class
    vertex-type: methods/fields/constructors/semantic relations (calls, reads, writes, sync, modifier)
    edge-type: method/fields/constructors are connected with undirected edges, with a semantic node inbetween them
    vertex-features: n/a
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: not specified
    graph-features: |-
      several subgraphs are isolated, by taking all subsets of <= 2 methods/fields/constructors,
      and extracting the subgraphs reachable from those nodes.
    other-features: |-
      Every subgraph is encoded using the  Weisfeiler Lehman kernel. 
      The resulting vectors are combined by first computing three vectors through min/max/mean pooling,
      and then concatenating these.
