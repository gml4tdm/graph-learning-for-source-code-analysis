    vertex-type: ast
    edge-type: ast
    vertex-features: node type and tokens are used as features
    edge-features: n/a
    connectivity-features: Not specified
    graph-features: certain sub-trees are extracted from the AST based on node type. Note that these are used as "labels"; the full AST is used as input.

    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - embedding matrices for node type and tokens; fused through linear layer
      - tree based CNN, but with attention-weighted summing for pooling
      - Predict probabilities of sub-trees
tasks:
  embedding:
    training-objective: For each sub-tree type, predict its probability of occurring in the full AST
