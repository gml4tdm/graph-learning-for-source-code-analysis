      The regular AST is taken, and all connections are "moved down" to the leaf nodes;
      non-leaf nodes are removed.

  model-1:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - RNN
      - GGNN (Edge type specific)
      - RNN
      - these layers are not quite specific; the general idea is interleaving layers
      - pointer network
  model-2:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - Transformer
      - GGNN (Edge type specific)
      - Transformer
      - these layers are not quite specific; the general idea is interleaving layers
      - pointer network
  model-3:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - Transformer w/ attention based on connectivity (edge type specific; biases is added in attention computation based on linear layer)
      - pointer network
tasks:
  var-misuse:
    training-objective: Given a graph, generate 2 pointers, one to the variable occurrence with the wrong name, and 1 to _a_ occurrence of the correct variable name

    working-objective: Given a graph, generate 2 pointers, one to the variable occurrence with the wrong name, and 1 to _a_ occurrence of the correct variable name
    working-granularity: n/a
    application: Variable misuse correction/detection
