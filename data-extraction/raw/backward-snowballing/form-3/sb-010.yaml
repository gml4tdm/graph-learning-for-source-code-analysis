    architecture-attributes:
      - Code snippet tokens processed using embedding layer w/ LSTM
      - Nodes in graphs encoded using LSTM, where the input of the LSTM is the collection of 1- and 2-hop neighbours of a given node
      - By default, only tokens from the query are used, except for tokens representing APIs; then corresponding node embedding is used by decoder
      - Decoding through LSTM w/ attention and softmax output
