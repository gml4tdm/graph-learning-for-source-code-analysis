      AST linearised through pre-order traversal. (node types for internal, payload for leafs)
      
      Two matrices are extracted:
        1) Shortest path distance matrix where M_{ij} denotes the signed length of the shortest path between node i and j, provided it is less than some threshold p ($\infty$ otherwise)
        2) Sibling distance matrix where M_{ij} denotes the signed distance between siblings i and j. $\infty$ if exceeding some threshold

    architecture-attributes:
      - transformer encoder/decoder with modified attention mechanism
      - The attention mechanism incorporates the information from the two matrices (see paper for details)
