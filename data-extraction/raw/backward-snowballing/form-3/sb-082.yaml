      methods from diff are extracted. AST is computed for old and new versions.
      terminal to terminal paths in the ASTs are computed. Paths present 
      in both old and new version are discarded. 
      For the terminal nodes, tokens are features. 
      The path itself (sequence of types, interlaced with up/down directions) are also features (i.e. a full path is a single feature)
models:
  model:
    name: n/a
    architecture-attributes:
      - Re-uses the pre-trained code2vec model and applies transfer learning. Rest of bullet points give the code2vec details.
      - embedding layers for tokens and paths
      - concat start token, path, and end token embeddings
      - fnn
      - attention-weighted sum of path vectors
      - (if necessary, softmax for prediction)
