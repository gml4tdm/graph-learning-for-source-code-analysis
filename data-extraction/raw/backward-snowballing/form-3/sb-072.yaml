    architecture-attributes:
      - gin (multiple layers; take the average of the max-pool over each layer)
      - graph embedding fed into LSTM network together with previous hidden state (which represent edit history); used to compute edit type and location
      - second LSTM (c = LSTM(edit type, LSTM(edit location, history))) to compute embedding used for value or type prediction
      - pointer network for edit location prediction
      - value for leaf node predicted using attention mechanism; either copy from local or global dictionary
      - softmax to assign types for nonterminal nodes
