# !Important Notes About Tags!

The tags contained in the files here, including the `data.json` files,
were slightly further simplified for presentation in the paper.
Specifically, we applied the following further simplifications:


### Domain Tags
```
general graph learning framework for code -> general purpose frameworks
```

#### Domain Tags -- Child Tags
For the domains specifically, we have a more elaborate breakdown of the domains
in the actual paper. These tags are obtained by examining the
Â¨tag history" of the papers, i.e. look at the tags prior to refinement
into the final domain.

Below, we show a breakdown of all domains with their sub-domains
which we included in the paper, as well as any renaming actions
we performed for conciseness in the paper.
